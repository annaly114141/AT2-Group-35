       " 'I love drinking green tea.  It is delicious hot or cold, but being able to take it with me anywhere was key.  So I searched long and hard for an alternative to canned and bottled green tea which can be cumbersome, expensive and hard to come by in most parts of the US.  In the beginning, what I found was either too expensive, had sugar in it (which defeats the purpose of drinking green tea in the first place) or did not get very good reviews.  Then I found this product and quickly ordered it at the great price and free shipping.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The product works as advertised.  It dissolves quickly in cold water making it great to carry anywhere and it tastes great too.  The instructions say to use one packet for 8 ounces of water, but actually it should be used with 16 ounces of water, otherwise it can be too bitter.<br /><br />It not only saves money, but has replaced my canned green tea completely eliminating the number of cans that I need to recycle monthly.',\n",
       " \"This was my first experience of a bad Darjeeling - before, I hadn't known there was such a thing. The first brew yielded a dark rust color tinged with olive-green. The bottom of the cup was invisible. The taste was sharp and astringent. Thinking I'd brewed too long or too strong, I set the first cup aside and tried again. And then again. A light brew of 3 minutes improved the clarity; however, nothing I have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that I associate with lesser teas. The wet leaves are the typical size, light brown but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares.  The aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay - neither moldy nor spoiled, just old. In contrast, the Davidson's Keemun Conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious Keemun Conjou and nothing else.<br /><br />Given the price, I knew I was gamboling and consider this a lost bet. I have given the product two stars instead of one, because I haven't thrown it out (yet). I keep a supply of Lipton's bulk tea for emergencies such as long periods of unemployment, and I don't really need more emergency tea. Perhaps it will work for iced tea.<br /><br />By no means am I an expert, but I do value tea, and so I hope this opinion helps other buyers who are trying to decide between two Darjeelings. Davidson's ships quickly with value pricing, and so I am not giving up on the merchant. Just on this particular Darjeeling.\",\n",

Through an open door one can see two little bears already asleep in their bed. All in all, a cozy room of happiness and warmth and the promise of sleep.<br /><br />I sip my cup of Sleepytime tea quickly, almost gulping.

It is great, and with recent changes in Twinings lineup, I\\'m sure more people like me are out there looking for a good replacement-- so I hope this will be helpful to some who are doing as I have done. I took a blind chance on this tea-- and I am so glad I did. I\\'ve been a fan of black currant iced tea ever since I first tried it. For years I used Twinings brand, but they have changed their formula and I have read many negative reviews, so I decided to look for a new brand. I tried several others and Mighty Leaf black currant has been the best so far.  If you are a fan of Twinings Black currant (the original) and/or you like the black currant iced teas served by Jason\\'s Deli or Corner Bakery, you will probably really like this tea as it has a very similar taste. It is slightly stronger and has a little more of a \"bite\" than Twinings version did, (which I like)  and it is an excellent quality tea all around. There are several brands out there whose interpretation of what black currant tea tastes like is very far removed from this flavor I am familiar with. A few of them I tried were just downright weird. I am not really sure which black currant taste is more \"authentic\" to be honest, I just know what I like and I am very very happy with this tea. I will be buying this brand from now on for making my iced tea. It is well worth having to order it.',\n",

It helps to hold our constitution together and provides structure, fluid balance, endurance and strength. It is the slow, stable, calming, sweet and cold aspect of the self and governs our resistance to disease and promotes self healing.<br /><br />An imbalance in kapha leads to respiratory illnesses, excess cough/cold symptoms, weight gain, general feeling of laziness/heaviness.<br /><br />Kapha tea is an excellent antidote to a kapha imbalance - the tea itself is spicy and invigorating with strong notes of cardamom, ginger followed by cinnamon and lemon verbena.

Steep it long enough so that all the flavor intensity is in your cup (or tea pot) Drink it straight, with no sugar -- OR-- sweeten it to bring out even more of its wonderful flavor -- AND for a special treat, add cream or milk or soy milk-- your Earl Grey will take on a \"Chai presence\"!!!

       " '****<br />This Kava Stress Relief Tea from Yogi Tea is for anxiety relief. It\\'s an unusual tea, slightly sweet (it contains stevia) and very carob-y. The good news is that it does not have any of the usual kava taste or smell that many people find offensive. The bad news is that I can\\'t feel any of the anxiety relief effects of the tea, although it does say that there are 78mg of kava root extract in the tea. Still, it\\'s a lovely cup of tea, and relaxing because it just tastes good. I can also taste the spiciness of the tea, which is very pleasant. I usually brew two bags in one cup, which is recommended on the package for a stronger and more relaxing effect; however, I even tried four bags once, but still didn\\'t notice a relaxing effect. I am familiar with kava and the overall effect of kava is pretty subtle anyway, so this is something to be aware of. Your experience of the tea may be different.<br /><br />Kava Stress Relief Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it\\'s not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh) and has many organic ingredients.<br /><br />The ingredients in Kava Stress Relief Tea are: kava root extract, carob pod, Indian sarsaparilla root, organic cinnamon bark, organic ginger root, organic cardamom seed, stevia leaf, barley malt, natural hazelnut flavor, natural cinnamon flavor, and natural licorice flavor. Amazingly, I can taste many of these in this lovely and complex cup of tea. I would rate the taste five stars for flavor and uniqueness.<br /><br />Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make. Their tea bag tags have metaphysical sayings on them like, \"Your breath is the voice of your soul\" and \"Your head must bow to your heart\".<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea\\'s benefits: \"Kava Stress Relief tea helps you calm down as it relieves stress, anxiety and minor pain, as well as lending gentle support to the digestion and the kidneys. A member of the peppercorn family, Kava (Piper methysticum) is a highly prized medicinal and beverage plant, whose primary benefit is alleviating anxiety. \"Kava-kava,\" native to Oceania and the South Pacific Islands, has been used and cultivated for its ability to calm the body and mind, and encourage a good night\\'s sleep. A powerful antispasmodic, this herb promotes a state of \"relaxed unconcern\" while compromising neither mental functions nor clarity of thought when used appropriately. Furthermore, Kava has been shown to relax the uterus and relieve menstrual cramps and minor menopausal symptoms.* The Herb Research Foundation (2000) indicates that scientific data supports the use of kava for minor anxiety, stress, restlessness, muscle tension and mild pain. For added flavor, our formula has been complemented with Stevia, Sarsaparilla and Organic Carob. Enjoy a warm soothing cup of Kava Stress Relief, a delicious way to relax.\"<br /><br />In addition to the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease, there is a warning on the box, \"Ask a healthcare professional before use if you have or have had liver problems, frequently use alcoholic beverages, or are taking any medication. Stop use and see a doctor if you develop symptoms that may signal liver problems (e.g., unexplained fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, fever, vomiting, dark urine, pale stools, yellow eyes or skin). Not for use by persons under 18 years of age, or by pregnant or breastfeeding women. Not for use with alcoholic beverages. Excessive use, or use with products that cause drowsiness, may impair your ability to operate a vehicle or heavy equipment.\"<br /><br />Note that the media scare about kava several years ago was not for the kava root, and it is my opinion that based on my own research that kava is very safe. However, I am not a physician, and if you have any health concerns, you should check with an appropriate professional.<br /><br />I decided to give Kava Stress Relief Tea four stars since it didn\\'t really work for me. Still, it is a wonderful and recommended tea, and may work for you!<br /><br />UPDATE: R. and Benjamin say in the comments that it is important to use hot but not boiling water as the boiling water may kill the part of the kava that helps one be relaxed. Please see my comment section for more information. Thanks to R. and Benjamin for their comments.<br />****',\n",

It takes the edge off stress and is an enjoyable tea for morning or nightime!

It has a good, clean flavor you can only get from a full leaf tea like this.<br /><br />Now - a thing or two about Rishi's actual brewing instructions. This is the second Rishi tea I've tried, and like the first, the quality is great and I've been thoroughly enjoying it. If you follow Rishi's brewing instructions, however, you will get an overly potent, undrinkable mess instead of the mild, subtle yet undeniable flavor of a properly brewed green tea. Green tea isn't supposed to taste like the crap you get at Panera or from Lipton - you're not supposed to be assaulted by intense flavor when you drink it. If you follow Rishi's instructions though, that is what will happen and you'll probably end up writing reviews about how it tastes like grass.<br /><br />1 tablespoon per 8 ounces of water is beyond overkill. Brewing that for 3-4 minutes is even greater overkill. Like most other full leaf greens, 1 TEASPOON per 8 ounces of water brewed for between 1.5 to 2.5 minutes is what the brewing instructions on this tea should be. If I were to put 3 tablespoons of this stuff in my tetsubin and brew it for 4 minutes. . . I don't even want to know what would come out of the spout.<br /><br />So, 1 teaspoon/8 ounces of water for 1.5 - 2.5 minutes (2.5 is even pushing it) and you'll get an amazing green tea that has the subtlety and smoothness that you're supposed to get out of a green like this. If it's bitter or you feel like you're on a green tea roller coaster, you've brewed it wrong.\",\n",

What we were expecting, at the price we paid, was a relatively low-grade, re-branded tea.  That is not what we got.<br /><br />What we got was not only a consistently high quality tea, but also an astonishing value.  What really impresses me is that the quality and taste of this tea is so consistent; it's really the best black tea you can find, box after box, for the price anywhere near where they sell it, even much higher.  To be honest, I don't know how they do it but I'm delighted they do.  We buy this tea by the case.<br /><br />The flavor of this tea is crisp and clear, rich, but never bitter.  I had been accustomed to have my tea English-style with cream, but Newman's Own black tea is so flavorful and mellow I've taken to having it straight up all the time.  It's really that good.<br /><br />It would be a tremendous value as it is, but throw in the fact that it is organic, to boot, and it's just a steal.  All the bags in the box are individually wrapped.

In the beginning, what I found was either too expensive, had sugar in it (which defeats the purpose of drinking green tea in the first place) or did not get very good reviews.  Then I found this product and quickly ordered it at the great price and free shipping.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The product works as advertised.  It dissolves quickly in cold water making it great to carry anywhere and it tastes great too.  The instructions say to use one packet for 8 ounces of water, but actually it should be used with 16 ounces of water, otherwise it can be too bitter.<br /><br />It not only saves money, but has replaced my canned green tea completely eliminating the number of cans that I need to recycle monthly.',\n",

You can add a sugar or sugar alternative if you want, but I say it tastes great straight.<br /><br />I was expecting this to be a finely chopped powder, but as others have said, these are full petals (see my user added image).

I decided to first call Davidson and see how they would like to resolve the problem.  I received an e-mail response back from Davidson Teas and was told that they have a number of quality control measures in place (sifting and steam sterilization) to prevent problems of this nature.  The response from Davidson Teas unfortunately was \"If unsatisfied with product received, please file a claim with Amazon for exchange/refund\".  If purchasing product directly from them they stated \"we will exchange/refund without any questions asked per our PRODUCT GUARANTEE (on our website)\".  Overall I feel it is a good product at a good price from Amazon but Davidson Teas quality control slipped and when given the chance to resolve the problem failed to adequately address the situation.

I believe Yama Moto Yama is also in the Stash blend.<br /><br />As far as Green Teas go, this blend is among the naturally sweetest and has no bitterness... unless you overcook it. The trick I have found to getting the best flavour from Green Teas is not using too high a temperature to steep it. Steep at a lower temp (170F-180F) for a longer time which will result in a tea that is actually green in colour, not brown or gold. Also, this tea tastes best as is, don't put any sweeteners in it like sugar or honey.

Makes a fantastic tea in 3-4 hours, and letting it sit for a couple more hours produces a tea that definitely needs to be watered down. Needs no sugar, no lemon. Perfect as is. Awesome, just awesome. I wouldn't go a summer without it.<br /><br />I pick it up at Trader Joe's, and occassionally I find it at Target and Wal-mart. Nevertheless, considering that shipping is included in a subscription, Amazon's S&S price is fair and on-par with B&M retail outlets.\",\n",

Our organically certified CO2 decaffeination method removes only the caffeine while leaving all of the beneficial polyphenolic elements of Organic Green Tea (Camellia sinensis) intact. This method also maintains the antioxidant properties and delicate flavor of our delicious, organically-grown Green Tea.* Unlike other green teas, this special organic Green Tea has a delicate flavor with no bitterness. This formula incorporates the natural antioxidant properties of Green Tea with a concentrated, purified extract of Kombucha-Pure(tm). This extract is made from Kombucha grown in a unique medium of 32 supporting Chinese herbs and is produced without the use of refined sugar or black tea. For centuries, practitioners of herbal medicine have used Kombucha to detoxify the body, enhance the immune system, fight fatigue and soothe an upset stomach.* This convenient form of Kombucha can be taken daily for maximum health benefits.\"<br /><br />Yogi Tea\\'s use of \"Kombucha-Pure\", grown in 32 Chinese herbs and WITHOUT black tea or sugar is very, very appealing, and a new and exciting way of producing Kombucha.<br /><br />Note that Yogi Tea also makes a caffeinated version of this tea that has exactly the same ingredients except that the organic green tea does include caffeine.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****',\n",

I had only tried Starbucks Matcha (PLEASE BE ADVISED - it is very tasty, but probably because the number one ingredient on the label is sugar). Also, a pound of Starbucks Matcha (as sold on a popular auction site) costs about the same as a pound of Culinary Teas bulk Matcha)...so you are getting far less of the expensive and healthful green tea powder and more sugar (the Starbucks product is somehow micronized so it does mix into solution much easier than a less processed pure tea powder). The teaspoon on the right is Teavana (at $16 for 30 grams - thats 2 Tbsp) they said it was the highest \"tea ceremony\" quality matcha. The teaspoon on the left is the bulk (1 lb, silver bag) CT product. Photo taken without a flash and not retouched so actual colors show. CT matcha  is slightly less brilliant green. I mixed exact quantities (1/2 tsp) of matcha in 8 oz of liquid with exact quantities of sweetener (a blend of xylitol and stevia that I am experimenting with). The CT matcha tastes slightly less \"green\" and slightly more bitter than the Teavana, but I did the math ( a pound of CT would cost $240 at the Teavana $16 per 30 g cost) - so I am very happy with my CT purchase. Will use the smaller container for my \"working\" supply, freeze the rest and use as needed. Am finding Matcha to be a great substitute for my \"too much coffee\" habit and prefer the less instantaneous (but prolonged) energy boost it gives - not too mention alkalizing instead of acidifying, ECGC, and possible metabolism boosting effect.<br />PS Most Starbucks barristas do not know the Matcha powder contains sugar, so they will tell you the are not adding any.

       " 'The folks in the United Kingdom drink more PG Tips tea than any other brand, and perhaps after you try it; it will be your #1 choice, too! (By the way, the folks in Ireland drink more tea per person than in any other country.)<br /><br />PG Tips Tea and PG Tips Special Blend Tea is our home\\'s standard tea. There are a few specialty retailers in the USA that now offer the PG Tips Special Blend Tea and hopefully Amazon will do so soon.<br /><br />In the 1930s (the pre-digestive era in history) this tea was introduced by the name \"Pre-Gest-Tee\" suggesting the tea could be consumed before food was eaten, but it was the grocers who gave it the abbreviation of \"PG\" - and the company added \"tips\" (since the company uses only the best part of the tea plant, the two top leaves and bud of the tea plant to make the tea).<br /><br />Many black teas sold in the USA are graded the basic medium grade Orange Pekoe (generally the tea leaves below the top two and bud), which is one of the reasons PG Tips gets higher reviews than most other teas. PG Tips also uses their pyramid tea bag that allows ample room for the tea to expand as it is infused. Additionally, in my opinion, PG Tips blends only two blends, rather than blending a wide assortment, thus becoming really good at what they do.<br /><br />Here at Amazon PG Tips is priced at just over a nickel a tea bag (a good value for an imported product) when you order the 240 count boxes in a set of two, and even less expensive in the higher volumes. PG Tips makes wonderful ice tea too, and that\\'s good news since Americans drink about 80% of their tea as iced tea and only 20% as hot tea. Worldwide more hot tea is consumed than iced tea, and worldwide tea is the most consumed beverage (next to water), while in the USA it is the sixth most consumed beverage (next to water).<br /><br />A very good question to ponder is \"Why this is?\"<br /><br />Drinking an adequate amount of tea daily is now being considered to be very good for one\\'s health, and it is much more enjoyable to drink a really good cuppa (cup of tea), especially at the nominal cost of about a nickel a cup when compared to one of those gourmet coffee places who charge upwards of four to five dollars for a large cup of coffee.<br /><br />When we have a guest in our home we always offer them a PG Tips cuppa, and they always say they have never tasted a tea this good - thus, I rate it 5 stars for its quality and very nominal price!',\n",

As expected, PG Tips makes a stronger brew. Each PG Tips bag has so much tea that I can easily make a 12 ounce mug with a single bag.<br /><br />PG Tips is a sturdy, straight-ahead blend with more strength than Lipton\\'s. It is a caffeine-rich tea - in part because each bag has more tea than other brands.<br /><br />PG Tips uses a pyramid shaped bag that allows more room for tea leaves to expand while steeping. Does it make better tea? I don\\'t know, but it is a point of differentiation.<br /><br />HINT: PG Tips also makes a Special Blend black tea that is only slightly more expensive in stores. I much prefer the Special Blend to their regular black tea. The PG Tips Special Blend is a very hardy and rich breakfast tea. The Special Blend is more sensitive to longer steeping times (I usually steep mine less than 3 minutes), but I find the taste more complex and satisfying.<br /><br />Many prefer loose tea because tea bags contain the less expensive \"fannings\" or \"dust,\" remains from processing loose leaf tea. And with some others brands of tea (not PG Tips), some people can taste the paper used in the bag.<br /><br />If you (like I) sometimes appreciate the convenience of bags, I recommend trying PG Tips as a sturdy everyday tea.

Then disaster struck - I was out of coffee! I remembered the green tea on the shelf and thought what the heck, maybe it will hold me over till I get to the store. I liked it! It gave me an afternoon pick-me-up that I wasn\\'t expecting and even thought it tasted pretty good as well.

The Orange gives just a hint of it\\'s flavor. Other reviewers felt otherwise, so I would suggest to try one box first and if you like it go for this multi-pack. I do agree though that it\\'s great for what ails ya. It\\'s definitly one I would drink for anything from colds and sore-throats to aches and pains of all sorts. I also read that the matcha leaf helps to cleanse the body of toxins.<br /><br />This blend brews up an appealing golden shade. It gives me a renewed and refreshed feel but I also found it to be more calming than the Lemongrass which gave me quite an energy boost.It also doesn\\'t seem to be dehydrating -as coffee can be - with more health benefits.Although I personally prefered the taste of the Lemongrass - my only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 - I still like this one and it is nice to have a litle variety for different moods or needs. And I don\\'t need to add anything.<br /><br />It is caffeinated, but comparably much less then coffee per serving.

       " 'Mate is actually not tea but a tea-like beverage originating from Argentina and Uruguay, and primarily consumed in those countries as well as in Paraguay and southern Brazil; brewed from the dried leaves and stemlets of the perennial Yerba Mate tree. Its name derives from the quichua word \"mati\" designating the gourd in which it is traditionally served.  On average, 300,000 tons of Mate are produced each year.<br /><br />In its consistency similar to green tea, mate has a distinctive, full, bittersweet flavor with a note of alfalfa, resembling that of tea but milder. Of the 196 volatile chemical compounds contained in Yerba Mate, 144 are also contained in tea.  Knowing its manifold health benefits - among the plant\\'s ingredients are the alkaloids xanthine, theophylline and theobromine as well as vitamins C, E, several B vitamins and numerous minerals - the South American Guarani Indians have traditionally used the plant for medicinal purposes, inter alia as a stimulant to the central nervous system, to promote mental, physical and cardiovascular activity, enhance resistance to fatigue, reduce fever, mitigate thirst and hunger, decrease blood pressure, and as a diuretic, laxative, purgative, sudorific, and antirheumatic.<br /><br />Legend has it that knowledge of the infusion\\'s powers was first imparted to a young Guarani woman and her father by a mysterious shaman, rewarding the woman\\'s faithfulness in staying with her exhausted father while her tribe continued their search for arable land.  In recent years, mate has become a cultural phenomenon throughout large parts of South America, and it is now gaining increased popularity in Northern America and Europe as well.  In South America, sharing mate from the same container and the same straw (bombilla) is a symbol of closeness and friendship, both in a family and in other social contexts.',\n",

Excellent taste - depending on how long the steeping process, it ranges from a very light, refreshing taste that goes well as an iced tea, to a very hearty - but not bitter - taste that really hits the spot.<br /><br />I've had better tasting tea, but on a cost/value basis, this is outstanding.<br /><br />The downside is that, as with any decaf loose tea, you're not getting the full leaf format that our caffeinated tea brethren enjoy. This is very fine, almost powdery in consistency. This is where the higher priced teas pay off -- whilie their decaf process also results in broken leafs, it is not anywhere as fine or powdery as this.<br /><br />The fine/powdery nature presents some challenges in brewing, since the typical perforated tea ball will not be suitable. I'm using a mesh tea ball and it works pretty well, albeit there is still some tea residue in the bottom of the cup. If you want absolutely zero leaf residue you'll need to use one of those tea bag systems where you put the loose tea in a bag. Those, however, are not reusable more than a few times. As usual, trade-offs.<br /><br />Of greater significance is that the decaf process for this particular tea is not perfect - there is still some caffeine left. I'm very sensitive to caffeine levels, and this tea clearly has more caffeine than, for example, a bagged Lipton decaf. I'd put the caffeine level below what a regular green tea would hold, but there is still enough there to be noticeable. Again, I'm very sensitive to caffeine, so for most people I imagine that would not be an issue.\",\n",
       " \"i've had insomnia for 5+ years. I used to be on meds like Ambien, Zoloft, and Elavil for the longest time. I also do have anxiety (hence the zoloft and elavil). I kissed all those meds goodbye when this tea came out. I don't reccommend you drink it while driving, cuz it did impair me many a time when i would drink it while i was out having dinner.<br /><br />It def does what is says. I've only tried the Green Tea & Honey - non carbonated bottle of tea. It tastes great, and doesn't leave a bad aftertaste at all. In fact, i don't even notice an aftertaste when i drink it.<br /><br />Active ingredients: Chamomile (reduces anxiety), Valerian (promotes relaxation), Passionflower (reduces anxiety), Hops (promotes relaxation and inhibits adrenaline), Melatonin (relaxes your muscles), and lemon balm (enhances mood, alertness & calm).<br /><br />This tea is better then any pill i've ever taken for my insomnia and anxiety. It's healthy and all natural. There is no crash afterwards like most drinks and meds. You will wake up refreshed.<br /><br />Drinking it will make you relaxed and laid back (mellow). You will most likely fall asleep. (This is on 1 bottle). I have done 2 bottles - they reccomend not going over 2 bottles, and if you drink 2 bottles to separate it by 8 hours from the last one. I drank bottle 2 after 3 hours of drinking the last one. i only made it thru a 1/4 of bottle #2 before i passed out in my bed. Doing 1 bottle is like equivalent to 1 5mg pill of ambien, but doing 2 bottles is like equivalent to 20-25mgs of Ambien (and the legal highest dose for Ambien i am told is 20mg), so 2 bottles is pretty strong.<br /><br />I love it, and i definitely reccommend it to other ppl who have anxiety and insomnia. I love it so much i want a month supply of it.<br /><br />I have heard rumors that it may contain kava kava as well, even though none of the bottles have this listed on it.\",\n",

Like the bees took it straight from ivy and bark.<br />I most commonly use honey for my tea in the morning and the rancid portion of this honey is so overwhelming that it ruins the tea, so I tried using it for cooking thinking that would be better, so I baked banana bread with it, after it came out of the oven I couldn't even taste the banana, the honey completely overpowered everything else.<br />Now I'm stuck with five unopened bottles of this useless honey, what now?\",\n",

I prefer other teas for flavor, for sipping and savoring, but this is what I drink the most of, as a refreshing and healthy beverage, and it is very good for that purpose.<br /><br />The Amazon description, saying this is Bai Mu Dan, is incorrect. It is actually fannings. Fannings is the second to the smallest leaf size. Fannings are used in tea bags because of their small size and economic price. On the Uncle Lee\\'s tea website, this tea is shown just as white camellia sinensis. The Uncle Lee\\'s Organic White tea that is described as Bai Mu Dan on the Uncle Lee website is $5 for 18 bags.<br /><br />The only other pure white tea I\\'ve had is Republic of Tea\\'s Emperor\\'s white tea, which I find superior to this tea, having a milder and sweeter flavor that is even more pleasant to drink without sweetener than this one. The Uncle Lee\\'s white tea is closer to an oolong in both color and flavor than the Emperor\\'s, with just a hint of bitterness and none of the herbal tones of a green tea.<br /><br />That said, the RoT Emperor\\'s White is almost 6 times more expensive than this tea, and Uncle Lee\\'s is still easy to drink without sweetener, so I\\'ll save the Emperor\\'s for special moments and use the Uncle Lee\\'s as my \"daily drinker.\"<br /><br />Having more flavor, I find that this makes an excellent iced tea.  I usually use 4 bags of this, and one bag of Republic of Tea\\'s Cherry Green Tea, to a gallon of water plus 2 heaping teaspoons of natural cane sugar to provide just a hint of sweetness in a very refreshing iced tea that everyone loves.',\n",

These 40 count boxes are not packaged individually in foil packs but there are 4 tea bags in 1 foil pack and not resealable.  Therefore, if you're not a frequent tea drinker, the tea bags might loose freshness after you open the foil pack after a few days.  If you want individually packaged tea bags, you should look at the Bigelow Green Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6).<br /><br />If I leave the tea bag in my cup for more than a minute, I will see loose tea particles on the bottom of my cup, leaving the last mouthful of tea undrinkable. This problem does not happen in the I Love Lemon tea by Bigelow even if I leave the tea bag in my cup for more than 10 mins.  I'm not sure if there's a same problem in the Bigelow Green Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) because I haven't tried that yet.<br /><br />Taste wise - okay, same as any ordinary green tea.<br /><br />Drink for health benefits!\",\n",
       " \"The iced tea K-cups are more expensive than the coffee, but even so, the convenience has made them a winner with me.  The effort to make a single glass of freshly brewed iced tea is sufficiently daunting that I was never inspired to do it.  I'm not a fan of the bottled or instant versions and don't drink enough to warrant making a whole pitcher so I rarely drank iced tea at all even though I like it, particularly with lemon, until I discovered this stuff.  When I tried the sample pack of iced teas I received with an order of coffees, this lemon appealed to me the most and I've been reordering it ever since.  It suits my need for speed and ease and I find the flavor as good as fresh brewed.<br /><br />I use a pint Mason jar since I don't have a proper 16 oz glass that can withstand the initial heat.  It's a bit rustic, but it works fine.  You fill the glass with ice cubes and using one of the lower volume settings on your brewer, you let the hot tea fall directly into the ice filled glass.  Within a few seconds, it's chilled and ready to drink.<br /><br />Even though this is supposed to be pre-sweetened tea, it's not sweet enough for me and I add more sugar or Stevia.  To me it tastes fresh brewed with just the right amount of lemon and is done in seconds.  Since there are other teas I'm very fond of in K-cups, I tried the same method to make iced tea from those, but it doesn't work because they get too diluted.  This type is stronger and stands up to the extra dilution from the ice.  It provides me just the cooling pick-me-up I need during these super hot days.  Recommended to those who enjoy iced tea and appreciate a quick and effective preparation method.\",\n",

       " 'I refuse to refer to the mushroom in this tea as \"Ganoderma\".  It\\'s Reishi.  It\\'s been Reishi for thousands and thousands of years.  I don\\'t know why the Organo company tried to get all fancy and used a lesser common name for the medicinal mushroom.<br /><br />With that said, onto my review... I like the tea.  I notice beneficial effects of drinking it.  Infused with the Reishi, it seems to sustain the energy you get from the caffeine, rather than a crash and burn I get from other green teas.  I feel the beneficial effects of this tea over a period of sometimes, 3, 4, 5 hours.  It\\'s balanced, easy going energy, and I feel like I do get a slight bit of oxygenation in my body as well.  I can even drink this tea right before bed, and I\\'ll sleep like a baby.<br /><br />The taste... not great.  It does taste like Green Tea, but it tastes like you diluted a normal cup of green tea with 8 oz of water.  It brews very weak.  The color is just an ever so slight tint of green.  It doesn\\'t seem like much even comes out of the bag, and it tastes like it.  I\\'m assuming since there\\'s the Reishi in there, that\\'s why.  The Reishi actually brews clear, so it would make sense that the tea is a lesser color.<br /><br />All in all, do I think this stuff is worth almost 90 cents per cup?  No.  Certainly not.  I buy bulk organic japanese green tea for literally, 10 cents per tea bag.  So paying 9x that for tea isn\\'t really too appealing.  I\\'m a big Green Tea drinker.  I usually drink 3 cups a day.  That would be almost $3 per day for this tea.  What I do, to save costs, is buy Reishi tea, and dump that into a cup of green tea for the ultimate cup of tea.<br /><br />Amazon offers Reishi tea (again, which Organo calls Ganoderma)[...], as well as super cheap bulk organic green tea.  Try this recipe -- 1 cup Reishi, mixed with 1 cup of Green Tea.  Put them together in a large cup or thermos, and enjoy.  You\\'re getting the same stuff (more Reishi, actually, which is truly the good stuff) for less than half the cost.',\n",

       " 'I am very surprised that I felt the way I did after trying one of these 5 hour energy drinks.  I did not think there was that much caffeine in each one but apparently there is because I had the jitter attacks bi-time which started about ten minutes after I finished the bottle.  I got the sick feeling and it did not go away for, well about 5 hours actually.  I was very close to putting my finger down my throat to try to throw it up thinking maybe that would make me feel better, although I\\'m a pretty big wimp so I didn\\'t do that.<br /><br />I am not overly sensitive to caffeine but while the 5-hour energy drink obviously works for some people, it did not work for me.  I tried green tea capsules about a week later (yes I was on the hunt for a good energy booster) and I have not had one negative experience to report.  I also recommend raspberry ketones which I take with the green tea, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008HYRW6G\">Green Tea Extract 60 Capsules (500mg) + FREE 25 Grams Raspberry Ketones Powder</a>.  I think I found a good combination for me, finally.<br /><br />The only reason I need to take something for energy is because I start work at 5am everyday, which means I get up at 3:45am!  I try to stay away from coffee and based on my own experience and research green tea extract is the most natural and effective energy booster I know of that I can take without any side effects.

I still miss that kick I got from my morning cup of coffee but that is one experience I do not wish to repeat.<br /><br />Coca tea has a very delicate taste but the taste is enhanced with a small amount of sugar is added.

This Green Tea is a blend of Japanese Green Teas, which are more robust and flavourful than typical Chinese Greens. The only Green Tea I've tasted that compares is straight Yama Moto Yama from Japan. I believe Yama Moto Yama is also in the Stash blend.<br /><br />As far as Green Teas go, this blend is among the naturally sweetest and has no bitterness... unless you overcook it. The trick I have found to getting the best flavour from Green Teas is not using too high a temperature to steep it. Steep at a lower temp (170F-180F) for a longer time which will result in a tea that is actually green in colour, not brown or gold. Also, this tea tastes best as is, don't put any sweeteners in it like sugar or honey. If you are addicted to sugar, ween yourself off of it and enjoy the great flavour of this premier Green Tea.<br /><br />Of course, Green Tea is incredibly healthy, rich in anti-oxidants and relaxing theanine, is not harmfully acidic like coffee and there is also one quarter the amount of caffiene than in coffee - easier to brew too!<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable considering the quality of tea you are getting.

Only problem is that each pyramid is not individually wrapped, therefore you must put them in a tight container to prevent leakage of flavor or drink all 20 bags quickly.<br /><br />As to the tea, it's advertised mainly as Bavarian wild berry flavor, and there is a lot of that, but actually you can taste a lot of hips flavor as well. Not surprising since the ingredients also contain rosehips, chicory root, cinnamon bark and licorice root. Just to let you know that it's not all berry flavor.<br /><br />All in all, I like this a lot and would buy it again.\",\n",

Tetley's British Blend is real tea, not the pallid, anemic apology for tea that skulks in silly little bags (twee bags) with strings and tags and staples and other absurd paraphernalia attached, in a vain attempt to disguise the uselessness of trying to extract any vestige of taste from the contents.  These are round, robust bags that sit purposefully at the base of the cup and mean business.  They contain real tea with real taste.  Make sure the water is boiling hot when you pour it on, give the bag a minute to soak - encourage it with a little squeezing - then add a drop of low-fat milk or a slice of lemon and enjoy a true cuppa, taking time to sneer at the poor, deluded fools around you, sipping at their pathetic rosehip infusions or vanilla flavored Lobsang Souchang Rama Gupta, or whatever it is.<br /><br />The shelf life is long enough for you to buy it in bulk, and Amazon's price is good, so treat yourself to a proper cuppa.

This tea can be found for 4-5 cents per tea bag and holds more than other teas such as Lipton. For me a good tea should be able to sustain a long brew time to get the most flavor without an excessive tannin taste. I can brew the amount above for 5 1/2 minutes with only 3 teabags. 4 bags would suit others. We put the tea in an airpot and it tastes good all day. Just try that with Lipton \"tea dust\". It has been stocked in our local grocery stores over the last couple of years and I buy several boxes at a time. I bought 12 boxes from Amazon though because it was cheaper and tea keeps for months if not a year or more. I hope this tea catches on. Only 4 stars as there are other better tasting teas, such as Empress from Fairmont Hotels or a good pure Assam, but as noted this is a great economical everyday tea.',\n",

When I got this package I was skeptical, it looked suspiciously like nasty instant tea. I brewed it up however and to my delight, found it WAS the excellent ceylon black tea blended with a delightful mix of spices that give it a sweet tang that is wonderful to drink hot or cold. (tip, stew an apple in it with a little honey, oh my.)<br /><br />You will find some \"sludge\" at the bottom of the pan after brewing, as delightful as the brewed liquid is, avoid the tea fannings sludge, it\\'s a bit gritty. Otherwise, this is that wonderful tea they serve in the restaurants. They often serve it as a dessert with cream or sweetened evaporated milk added, though I personally enjoy it just iced.',\n",

I use about one cup of loose tea to 8 cups of water in the coffe machine. When it's all brewed and hot, I add the sugar, more water and keep it in the fridge. I add evaporated milk as needed, per each glass. It's a wonderful drink for a summer day!\",\n",

So it's not even the shipping that makes the price high.  It's good, but not enough to warrant paying the extra cost.<br /><br />And if you're looking to make Thai Iced Tea, don't follow the recipe on the label.

While that might not sound particularly appetizing, it's actually quite good.  However, I ONLY like it with a squirt of lemon juice (and sweetener).  Without lemon juice, I don't enjoy it, but I have to have lemon juice in my plain tea, as well.<br /><br />The flavor is distinctive enough that when I moved to a small town where the local store doesn't carry Morning Thunder, I didn't switch back to plain tea.  I had to start getting multiple boxes on my periodic trips to the big city.  I was delighted to find that Amazon now offers it at a price lower than most supermarkets.  Having it delivered (for free with Prime membership or Super Saver) is the ultimate in convenience.<br /><br />I don't find this tea particularly invigorating (not that I notice, anyway, which is perhaps a good thing), but the mate does seem to live up to its reputation as an appetite suppressant.  Whether it revs you up or not, it's a great way to get started in the morning.  And with the astonishingly high level of antioxidants (due both to the tea and the mate), you can actually feel good about drinking it.<br /><br />Don't be alarmed by the six-pack size.  It's a good enough tea that you'll go through it quickly.  Each box is individually wrapped in plastic (as you'd get it at the store), so you can expect a long shelf life.\",\n",

I was expecting a real potent punch, but upon reading that it had yerba mate in it, which I  drank in one of my favorite Chai mixes, I was sure it would be palate pleasing and I was right! This tea is very simple, as the ingredients list is short; roasted mate and black tea- no fillers, no funny stuff and no funky herbs and spices.  Upon further search on the internet of it I found out that Yerba Mate is an herb that is traditionally prepared as an energizing tea and consumed by natives of South American countries as it contains high concentrations of antioxidant flavonoids possessing potent free radical quenching activity.  It also includes several B vitamins, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Beta-Carotene and Calcium. Mixed with black tea, the Mate tastes like dark chocolate, just a hint mixed with the tea, it's a subtle yet an eye opening experience upon the first sip.<br /><br />I try to take good care of my health and drink lots of tea and water, but I had no idea how high in antioxidants this tea was! Per serving it had 1150mg, compared to 375 to 800 in broccoli, 600 to 900 in Tomato Juice and 650 to 1100 in Orange Juice. Tea is much easier to prepare than eating a bowl full of broccoli and drinking tomato juice, and it's quite refreshing and also tasted nice with some milk and sugar. I don't add lemon to it, just sugar and I let it soak in for about 3 minutes. Its makes a slightly smoky, chocolaty and exotic brew, yet it's still tea can be drank at breakfast or tea time.

I recently found this product and recommend it highly.<br /><br />One teabag makes a large pitch of this pleasant, mild tea.  It's taste reminds me a bit of Sugar Smacks without the sugar, or even Sheerios.  Doesn't sound like a good taste for tea you say?  Well, you'd be suprised.

       " \"The idea of boiling grain to make a tea never occurred to me.  Surprisingly in Seoul, many restaurants serve barley tea, called bori-cha as their standard free beverage.  Most of my Korean colleagues love it.  It is a kind of cultural icon.  Growing up with Honey nut Cheerios, I assumed that barley needs honey, so I added honey to my barley tea and it is to die for.  My Korean colleagues consider this sacrilege, but I still recommend it.<br /><br />Barley tea is also popular in Japan and Ecuador.  Apparently, we are behind in the discovery of this wonderful tea.<br /><br />The taste of barley tea is a bit like regular tea, say Lipton, but softer.  Most importantly for me, this tea is healthy and natural.  I don't drink coffee, black or green tea for health and personal reasons.  Tea made from barley is healthy, refreshing and enjoyable.

       " \"I was quite excited to try Lipton's new Tea & Honey To Go packets. While I was a bit skeptical of the five calories proposed for each 8-ounce serving, seeing as how honey is a fairly high caloric sweetener, I figured I'd give it a go anyway. So after receiving the tea, I mixed it up per the instructions and took a sip. Yowzas! The tea was super sweet with a bit of strawberry flavor and no tea that I could taste. I ended up watering the tea down enough that one packet, which is usually two servings, ends up as four or five 8-oz. servings. The berry flavor became very diluted while there was still that taste of icky sweetness. Overall the berry flavors and tea are weak, even undiluted, and I noticed no honey flavor what-so-ever, so took a look-see at the ingredients where I spotted sucralose (an artificial sweetener) thrown right in the middle of things. Now that is where the sweetness is and don't take kindly to that addition, as I avoid artificial sweeteners whenever possible. Seeing as how Lipton is sneakily claiming this is sweetened with honey (And look! NO aspartame!), with no mention that in actuality the sweeteners are honey granules, which are made from both honey and sugar, and sucralose except by viewing the ingredients list, makes me angry because I've been swindled. Yeah, this is natural all right. I'm definitely not going to trust Lipton's marketing from now on and urge them to think about switching to a natural sweetener such as stevia. So if you like your food natural, best to skip this, but if you're not so picky and don't mind artificial sweeteners in your food, then give it a go if you're interested. I'll not be trying any other flavors of this product.\",\n",
       " 'The product\\'s name lead me to believe it would be naturally flavored with flavors I like.  Unfortunately, the flavor of the artificial sweetener is very pronounced and it is a flavor I strongly dislike.  I do not use artificial sweeteners and avoid artificially sweetened beverages because I do not like the flavor, not for health reasons.<br /><br />I used one packet per 24 oz bottle of water and I am sure that if I were to mix it per instructions it would be way too sweet.  I was not able to taste honey or pomegranate.  Blackberry is somewhat pronounced, although not as a natural but as an artificial blackberry flavor.<br /><br />I also had a problem with packaging.  When I tore the corner of a packet at notch, the resulting hole was too small for the contents to pour out.  I had to jiggle the packet and push the contents out.  That created a cloud of fine dust which I inhaled - not pleasant.  I struggled with the second packet as well.  It is possible that it is just the batch I received that did not have the tear notch punched properly.<br /><br />The description says \"Sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors.\" I am surprised this kind of marketing is allowed or tolerated.  It is just as much (probably more if you consider contribution to the total sweetness) sweetened with artificial sweeteners as it is with honey.  As for the green tea or pomegranate flavor...  Who can tell that this tastes anything like either one of those things?  It seems like a manufacturer can show to a cousin of a random employee a picture of tea leaves and pomegranates and let them listen to bees buzzing and then claim that the product was made with tea leaves, honey, and real pomegranate flavor.<br /><br />I would not buy this product the way it currently is.',\n",

The flavor lasts for several minutes (which is unusually long for Spry gums). The combination of green tea and xylitol tastes a little like green tea ice cream (if you've ever had the opportunity to try that).<br /><br />I really like that the gum is flavored with xylitol. Unlike some brands that advertise that they contain xylitol, Spry actually uses it as their only sweetener. Most sugarless gums make me sick, as I can't handle sorbitol and maltitol well. It's great that I can chew this without having intestinal problems, which is certainly worth an extra star despite the flavor not lasting as long as I would like.\",\n",

This Green Tea is a blend of Japanese Green Teas, which are more robust and flavourful than typical Chinese Greens. The only Green Tea I've tasted that compares is straight Yama Moto Yama from Japan. I believe Yama Moto Yama is also in the Stash blend.<br /><br />As far as Green Teas go, this blend is among the naturally sweetest and has no bitterness... unless you overcook it. The trick I have found to getting the best flavour from Green Teas is not using too high a temperature to steep it. Steep at a lower temp (170F-180F) for a longer time which will result in a tea that is actually green in colour, not brown or gold. Also, this tea tastes best as is, don't put any sweeteners in it like sugar or honey. If you are addicted to sugar, ween yourself off of it and enjoy the great flavour of this premier Green Tea.<br /><br />Of course, Green Tea is incredibly healthy, rich in anti-oxidants and relaxing theanine, is not harmfully acidic like coffee and there is also one quarter the amount of caffiene than in coffee - easier to brew too!<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable considering the quality of tea you are getting.

The glowing reviews here sealed my decision...but alas, I sadly haven't found this to be as wonderful as they did. I find this tea to be pretty bland no matter how little or long I steep it, and there's barely a trace of either mint to be detected.

This brand does not need refrigeration, as it has gone through some sort of processing (pasteurization perhaps, yeast removal, I don\\'t know really) to negate the need for storage and shipping complications.  Of course, the downside is that health benefits attributed to natural kombucha are somewhat lost here, since processing kinda tends to that, but it still contains bacteria cultures (at least according to the label), it\\'s still \"organic\" and most importantly, it still retains that vinegary kick that sort of defines the kombucha taste.  Make no mistake, this product is far sweeter than GT Dave\\'s, 60 calories for an 8.4 ounce can (vs. 60 calories for a 16 oz bottle of GT\\'s ), but it\\'s still got some kombucha-y flavor.  It\\'s perhaps not as \"yeasty\", and is certainly missing any hint of alcohol from the original fermentation - I\\'d need a bottle of GT\\'s to compare to be sure - but it goes down nice and easy anyway.  It would be a good way to get into drinking kombucha for someone that isn\\'t used to it yet.<br /><br />So, it\\'s not a replacement for GT\\'s or any other naturally fermented and bottled kombucha product (several come to mind that have pulled from shelves), but it *is* tasty, organic, shelf stable, and convenient, and I like it for that reason.<br /><br />As for the flavor, I\\'ve tried two (of many) from this brand now, the \"traditional\" and the \"green tea and lemon\".  So far my preference leans to the \"green tea and lemon\" just because I like the tartness of the lemon.

       " \"This is a good matcha for the price. The best matcha can be much more expensive but well worth it, espcially if you happen to study the Japanese tea ceremony or you are a tea connoseur. If you do get this type of tea, it is wise to buy a proper bamboo wisk and sift it first, otherwise it can get lumpy. Making matcha the traditional way is well worth the effort and there is a LOT to learn about it. Some say to master the tea ceremony can take years.<br /><br />As far as the health benefits go, there is a lot of talk about green tea being good for you and I must say, I feel really good now that I am drinking it 1-3 days per week and I have even lost a few pounds. Matcha does have caffine and if I have more than two or three bowls I will definately feel it. It's probably a wise idea to not drink too much matcha before bed! Green and black tea both have caffine for the most part. Different teas have different amounts of caffine. It's a good idea to read labels carefully and do your research if you are sensitive to caffine or must avoid it. The type of caffine in a beverage also has a lot to do with how people respond to it. Caffine also has a different effect on everyone depending on your body. Some people get jittery, others don't and the more caffine you consume the less you will tend to feel the effects of it. I tend to feel jittery with coffee or soda but not with tea.<br /><br />Matcha is also great for smoothies, baking, ice cream and much, much more. Another note; Fresh matcha is a very bright green color, old matcha gets a darker pine-gray color to it and can taste bitter or ashy with a clumpy consistancy. Always note the date on the can. To avoid stale green tea, I reccommend storing it in an airtight bag and keeping it in the fridge. Stale tea isn't noticable when you put it in a smoothie or cake but if you make a hot beverage you will notice a big difference in the quality.<br /><br />Matcha is generally served with sweets and is good paired with fruity or vanilla desserts but it tends to clash with chocolate. Of course mochi (sweet rice cakes) go very well with matcha and are the traditional choice but unless you live near an Asian market, or you're a good cook, they can be hard to come by and have a short shelf life. The frozen Mochi ice cream nuggets are a good option too and sold in a lot of grocery stores.<br /><br />I reccommend this tea if you are new to drinking matcha. If you love it, it's the tastiest matcha in it's price range and if you hate it, at least you didn't waste too much cash. If you are taking tea lessons it's a good 'practice' tea and won't break your pocketbook, especially when you find out the price of tea bowls, fukusa, natsume, furo and the other utensils used in a tea ceremony!<br /><br />Regardless if you study Chado or if you are a casual tea drinker, I encourage all tea lovers to try matcha. The methods of making and preparing matcha are over 800 years old and when you taste it, you certainly understand why it's never gone out of style!\",\n",
       " 'Two other reviewers have already spoken. The most recent one attempting to undermine what the first reviewer had said. Actually, the first reviewer DOES know what he is talking about. Green tea DOES contain caffeine. This from an expert source:<br /><br />Caffeine<br /><br />Although black tea is thought to have the highest caffeine content of all tea, this is actually untrue. Green tea has more caffeine. However it must be understood that because of other compounds, the caffeine in green tea functions in a special and balancing way. The caffeine in green tea is surrounding by tannic acid compounds, which inhibit it from surging all at once into our bloodstream. In a sense, the caffeine in green tea is time-released into our bloodstream. This time-release effect makes the stimulation gentle and quite pleasant. It also allows us to feel the effects of green tea for an extended period of time, and outlasts the effects experienced by our friends, who are drinking coffee or cola. The effect of green tea makes us free of agitation and nervousness, and its blissful stimulation feels good to the senses.<br /><br />Enough said.........enjoy your tea.............',\n",

I use one heaping teaspoon per pint of hot water, and unfortunately with the more expensive variety it costs over five dollars per pint of matcha tea when you use this much.  Even so, if you can afford it, seek out the finer grades of matcha straight from Uji Japan.  The Uji region is famous for their fine Gyokuro tea and superior grades of matcha.  If you don't have that kind of money, this matcha could suffice, but try to get the Uji-based premium matchas, especially for special occasions.  This matcha is listed as being from Uji, but it isn't as good as the more expensive varieties from the same area.\",\n",

The family sized bags make 1 quart per bag, 48 quarts per box, 12 gallons of iced tea x 6 boxes @ $4.72 a box, thats 72 gallons of iced tea, certainly enough for the summer season and then some, plus free shipping if you play your cards right and order something else; you just can't beat that.  You can't get Luzianne cheaper anywhere else.<br /><br />So stop buying the instant iced tea mix crap, get some of these bags and brew your own.\",\n",
       " \"Prince of Peace Ginger Honey Crystals<br /><br />Unfortunately I got these on the last day of a local tea shop -- and I say unfortunately because I became instantly enamored of the product.  A single packet produces a decidedly strong 10-12 oz cup, very nice and gingery, reminiscent of the hot ginger tea sometimes served on cold winter days at a Haitian restaurant I know.  The honey adds a nice complexity to the cup, but I'm also looking forward to adding a few cloves and cinnamon stick.  Many other uses for the crystals come to mind as well as simply dissolving in water -- I've been using it to sugar tea, both black and green, and I'll definitely try another reviewer's recommendation for strawberries or other fruit.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I wish the packet had somewhat less sugar (but with the same ginger and honey strength).  One packet, at 17 g, is getting a bit close to typical desert levels (I checked some sorbet in my frig, 23 g).<br /><br />That aside, I prefer this to the ginger tea I've been getting at a local Korean market, a kind of marmalade or jelly with ginger slices in a jar.  Not only does this product have a stronger, hotter ginger flavor, but it can be used in place of granulated sugar.\",\n",
       " \"I am very into health and will research every product I consume until I am certain it's worthy.  I've tried 3 different organic matchas in the past and this is, by far, the best.<br /><br />This is a vibrant green color (very pretty color - especially when made)This is proof that young leaves were chosen and dried properly.  The brighter, the better.  Some matchas are dull green (dirty pea green color) - these are more of a food grade matcha (for baking, ice creams, etc.).  Food grade matchas have a dull taste as well. Ceremonial (drinking) tea should always be vibrant.  This is an excellent drinking tea.<br /><br />The packaging is the best I've seen.  Not only does it come in a sealed pop/top can, but once opened you will find your tea inside a sealed foiled bag. Impressive. A bit of a mess to empty the contents back into the can, but it makes for a very fresh tea.<br /><br />The taste of this tea is the cleanest I've tasty. Not at all bitter as some I've had. This is definitely the only matcha I will be ordering.<br /><br />From my research and own experience. I highly recommend keeping your matcha in the fridge to keep fresh.\",\n",
       " \"Having tried two different matcha powders thus far from Amazon.com, I am extremely impressed by the quality of DoMatcha's product. The other product I had ordered from Tao of Tea, while cheaper and 3 times the size and also of Japanese origin, simply does not compare to the fresh appearance and taste of DoMatcha's product. Exceptionally vibrant green color out of the box that turns into an extremely lush, dark forest green color upon addition of water, with an exceptionally fresh taste to match. If the matcha powder Starbuck's uses is taken as a token standard of like 100, Tao of Tea's matcha would be 80 or 90, while DoMatcha would be at least 125. The former two have colors of dull green and greenish-yellow respectively after water is mixed in with the matcha.<br /><br />I have not tried the really high-quality, really expensive premium matcha with elegant Japanese names and calligraphy on the cases they come in. But I am willing to bet that DoMatcha can quite hold its own against the super-premium labels/brands of matcha out there.\",\n",

For even more info on the health benefits of this type of tea go to mercola.com then do a search in Products for Royal Matcha. This one though, is even more expensive and not any better than Do Matcha that I can tell after doing alot of research.<br /><br />I drink this every day and it makes me more alert and sharp of mind without the crash of caffeine and stimulants. It does not taste like much, it has a very mild 'spinachy' taste, but I don't drink it because it tastes so good, I drink it for mental clarity, emotional support and for my health and immune support. I don't put it in hot water. I put it in about 24 ounces of room temperature water and agitate it with an egg whisk to blend it with the water, otherwise it clumps, hot or cold. They try to sell you a wooden whisk but I use the metal one that I already had and it works great. Just agitate it really good by rolling the handle back and forth in your hands in the drink very quickly until it is foamy and well blended and drink right away.\",\n",
       " \"I'm not a health nut by any means, yet I have often enjoyed a nice hot cup of green tea when I'm at my favorite sushi bar.  However, when I'd tried my hand at making green tea with packets, I could never come close to replicating the flavor and texture of the tea that I'd grown accustomed to at said sushi bar.  I'd even tried the $3 cup of green tea at Starbucks and it was a bitter experience for me.<br /><br />On a whim I decided to search out a better green tea experience and I found this gem here on Amazon.  The tin that the tea comes in was sealed securely.  Upon opening the tin, inside there was a sealed bag that I opened and poured into the tin carefully.  The arouma of the tea before brewing is pleasant to say the least - it has a fresh and mild scent that is not overbearing.  Brewing the tea was as simple as adding a small amount (about half a teaspoon) to a cup of warm to hot water.  I would not recommend boiling water as I did try that once and the tea clumped up at the bottom of the cup.<br /><br />This green tea looks and tastes wonderful.  I don't like adding sugar or sweeteners to my tea so it was an all natural taste.  It's got a smooth flavor and is not at all bitter like many other brands I've tried.  It tastes just as good as the green tea from the sushi bar and I'm more than pleased with it.  As a side note, I notice that some reviews recommend using ceremonial tools to enhance the experience.  I may try those tools in the future, but for now I am happy with the results of my rudimentary method for brewing.<br /><br />One tip - remember that less is sometimes more.  This small tin can last awhile if you ration the amount of tea you use per serving.  Use too much and you may experience clumping at the bottom.  Happy drinking!\",\n",

       " 'I have drunk \"english-blends\" of tea in various forms and guises. But being a wee bit Scottish, I tend to like everything in life, \"maxed-out\".  Almost all tea blends from various companies have FAILED to meet my criterion of \"Maximum Tea Experience\". Now, along comes Yorkshire Gold tea. Yorkshire Gold tea is carefully blended in North Yorkshire England by Taylors of Harrogate, and part of the real secret to this tea is the company\\'s attention to DETAILS.  Now undoubtedly, such teas like ASSAM (from North-East India) will give you some strength, but not always enough brightness.  \"Strength\" works well at the Middle and FINISH of the flavour gamut, but initially, it is Brightness which catches your palate\\'s attention and then the Stength simply Underscores it.  It\\'s sort of like playing a huge C chord on a concert piano in double octaves and then you gently add a LOW Contra C.  The deep low note brings out the richness of the chord.  The case is the same here with Yorkshire Gold.  So why Yorkshire Gold and not another brand?  The parent company in Harrogate is a superlative corporation who takes great pains at CONSISTENCY.  The magic is in the Details.  I am actually drinking a cup of Yorkshire Gold RIGHT NOW as I type this, and I can tell you, I have never found a company more consistent, attentive to details, and maddeningly insistent upon excellence.  Through myriads of experiments and counter-experiments, Taylors has discovered what GRABS the tea-drinker\\'s \"Gustatory\" attention, if you will.  But there\\'s more:  this blend both refreshes and relaxes you like none other.<br />Additionally, there is something here to which coffee drinkers may relate: AROMA.  When I make the loose or bag tea variants, both exude an almost beefy richness in bouquet.  The process of mixing furiously boiling fresh water with the tea invaribly and consistently produces a fine aroma akin to the scent of a British Sunday Lunch where a delectable roast beef is the order of the day.  Rich, piquant, and satisfying.  If your brand of tea does not do ALL that I have noted ... consider a change.',\n",

Luckily my coworker suggested me to try Essiac Cancer Remedy. I did a through research on Essiac and believed this tea was going to save my brother\\'s life and it DID. He is still well till now.  Later I suggested this tea to a few more cancer patients and the results were promising.  Two of them with early cancers were healed; the doctor just couldn\\'t find any cancer trace on the pre-scheduled surgery table.  There are 2 late phase cancer patients (late means cancer had been spread to different organs and the person was dying), who drank the tea and lived a few more months and died peacefully without any pain and sufferings, which proved what said in one of the Essiac books that the tea helps with a painless death if it\\'s a Terminal cancer. I also learned that the results are much better with patients who eat little or no animal products because animal food acidifies the body, speeds up cancer spreading and weakens the immune system --- in 1931, Otto Warburg won the Nobel Prize for showing that \"cancer thrives in acidic conditions.\"  For more information about this tea, you may read related books on \"Essiac\".

The jury is still out as far as to whether it will be a cure for my wife\\'s cancer, but I began taking it along with her and must admit that for me the effects have been remarkable. I have had a nasty case of psoriasis for 18 years. Dozens of trips to dermatologists and thousands of dollars worth of medication have not been able to arrest my condition like the Essiac/Flor-Essence tea has. The \"anger\" has subsided in my skin rashes and in just 2 months the sites have begun to clear up. In my case taking the tea has definitely boosted my immune system. Initially a cousin also tried the tea and after 3 days passed a kidney stone.<br />At present my wife is completely free of pain and doing reasonably well.<br />Some users complain about the taste, but it just tastes like celery or turnip juice.

       " 'I\\'ve been suffering some fairly severe health issues for the last few months, due to adrenal depletion. In my research on this, I\\'ve discovered that fatigued adrenals can overload the liver and gallbladder. Well, recently I realized that my adrenals are much stronger than before, so something else was amiss, resulting in my feeling fatigued constantly. When I developed a lipoma on my calf, I figured my lymphatic system was congested. I bought a liver detox kit and used it for a few weeks, but I didn\\'t really notice any results.<br /><br />Then I found websites talking about essiac tea. I had never heard of it, but people were making some pretty remarkable claims about it. As per usual, I immediately came to amazon to see what people here had to say about it (I feel confident that the reviews here are authentic). When I typed in \"essiac tea\" in the search module, it brought up Flor Essence. This product had terrific reviews, and I\\'d read how great it is for detoxing; so I figured, what have I got to lose?<br /><br />People claim that it has cured their cancer. I can\\'t make a comment on that, because as far as I know, I\\'ve got no cancer. But after taking this tea for a few days, I can definitely state that it seems quite potent medicinally. I\\'ve been taking 2 oz. of the brewed tea with 2 oz. hot water, 3 times a day. The third day I started feeling the typical flu-like symptoms of detox, and by day 4 I woke up feeling like a truck had hit me. My allergies and chemical sensitivities got really bad. I had a lot of sinus congestion. I could feel this stuff working. It\\'s been a little over a week now, and it\\'s still working great. I think the worst of the detox is over. I also started taking milk thistle and quercetin with vitamin C, and I think those supplements are assisting in the detox.<br /><br />Also, my boyfriend who never really thought he had digestive tract issues started taking this tea, just to maintain his health. Within a few days, he started seeing some nasty stuff (i.e. Candida, etc) come out in his bowel movements. So I guess this tea is also terrific for actually killing any parasites one may have. I can\\'t say that it will do so for everyone, but he and I are both having success with the tea. We even recommended it to his parents to try and are telling our friends about it. It\\'s not difficult to brew at all. After reading reviews where people said it was hard to do, I expected it to be grueling. It really doesn\\'t take that long to prepare. Most of the time is spent allowing the tea to brew overnight. When I make the tea, I\\'d say it takes me about 30 minutes in the evening and about 10 minutes the following morning.<br /><br />If you\\'re looking to detox, give this a go. Don\\'t increase the dosage beyond the recommended amount (as I\\'m apt to do, because I always want to speed things up!), because if you do, you\\'ll feel awful. But this day in age, I think it\\'s all vital that we complete a detox every few months or so. Our bodies simply have yet to catch up with the toxin overload created by the modern world. I\\'ve tried a few detox remedies, and this one, by far, is my favorite. I intend to use this tea for a very long time, if not for life.',\n",
       " 'My husband has taken the Flor-Essence tea since 1996 when he was initially diagnosed with Stage 2 prostate cancer. After being diagnosed with the cancer in 1995, he underwent radiation therapy. At the time, it appeared the radiation was successful since his PSA levels were normal. As you might imagine, we were both ecstatic about this. However, this happiness was short-lived.<br /><br />In 1996, a follow up PSA test showed the PSA level had started to increase. His urologist said this was not good believing the radiation did not get all of the cancer.<br /><br />After consulting with a local health food expert, I started my husband on the Flor-Essence tea, Flora Pro-Essence (specifically for the prostate), and modified citrus pectin (known to kill cancer cells). During an exam, his urologist told us after reviewing his PSA level (now normal), \"I don\\'t what you are doing, but whatever it is it\\'s working.\"<br /><br />Fifteen years later and still taking all three products, my husband remains cancer free and his PSA levels normal.<br /><br />We sincerely believe by taking these products it literally saved his life.

A bag is meant for a single cup of tea. Now, some people may prefer a weaker cup of tea, like my mum who will use a bag twice since she prefers a weaker cup, but one bag is really meant for one cup. Alas, to each his own. I personally like a very strong cup of tea so I use one bag per cup and I allow it to steep for a minimum of four minutes. Then I use a bit of half and half (whole milk at the minimum) and a half teaspoon of sugar. Wallah, the perfect cup.<br /><br />As for price, well, Amazon cannot be beat!

It\\'s a delightful, all natural tea made from ginger root, lemon grass, lemon peel, licorice root, black pepper, peppermint leaf, natural lemon flavor, ascorbic acid, and natural licorice flavor. Most of the ingredients are organic. The taste is lemony, peppery, slightly herby and a little sweet, very nice anytime, but especially after a meal. It\\'s a very unique tea that is a true treat.<br /><br />This is my second Yogi Tea to taste and review, and I am definitely impressed with the tea and the company. Lemon Ginger Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it\\'s not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea\\'s benefits: \"Lemon Ginger tea is a special healing formula designed to aid digestion, ease upset stomach and provide a caffeine-free pick-me-up. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) has been used for centuries to treat minor stomach ailments, warm the metabolism and reduce nausea associated with motion. Ayurvedic practitioners have historically regarded Ginger as the \"universal medicine\" because of the way it catalyzes the benefits of other medicinal herbs. The World Health Organization (1999) reports that Ginger stimulates the appetite and can be useful in a wide variety of stomach complaints. Made with Organic Ginger, this blend is formulated to boost digestion and circulation. The sourness of Lemon promotes the secretion of digestive juices and provides the perfect counterpart to the pungent-sweet taste of Ginger. Our formula is augmented with Organic Licorice, to support the adrenals and enhance the effectiveness of other healing herbs; Organic Peppermint, to help with digestion and reduce gas; and Organic Black Pepper, a powerful detoxifier. For centuries, Lemon and Ginger have been used together for their complementary tastes and healing properties. Enjoy a cup of Lemon Ginger tea when your tummy needs a little taming, when you need to reinvigorate your body and mind, or when you just want a delicious healthy drink.\"<br /><br />There is a warning on the box that if you have indigestion or heartburn that persists you should see a doctor. There are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />This tea has no caffeine and is entirely herbal. Note that Yogi Tea also makes a Green Tea Lemon Ginger that is mostly a green tea and that includes caffeine; the packaging looks a little similar, so make sure you\\'re getting the tea that you want.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****',\n",

Tea Zone matcha green tea powder, 8 oz. costs $16.99 (Amazon sells this as `Matcha Green Tea Powder By Malden Tea', but my black foil packaging label says it's made by Tea Zone)<br />(result: ****)<br /><br />3. Liquid Jade powdered matcha green tea 100% organic, 3 oz.

Each cup was clearly labeled.  I tasted the teas side-by-side, taking 3 sips of each before proceeding to next sample.  I tasted in random order until all 3 cups were consumed.  Total time: 15 minutes.  I took lots of notes and drew graphs etc.<br /><br />Result:<br />Serendipi Tea (5+ stars)  won for sweet smooth flavor, amazing long lasting froth bubbles, and the fact it's organic!!  Cost: $4.30/oz but worth it.  Note on the packaging: For those reviewers complaining of the green tea powder leaking, I have to point out that it's hand packed, with a note explaining that you must pack it yourself in an airtight and light-blocking container.  Fine with me, since this is the best tea I've found, and the act of packing it myself is itself a ZEN moment in which I feel a connection to the individual soul who packed the brown bag by hand just for me.  You decide.<br /><br />Tea Zone (Malden Tea) (4+ stars) came in second for a very nice flavor, but the frothy bubbles popped sooner than the Serendipi Tea, making for a lower rating, and plus, it isn't organic.  But it gets extra points for its low cost:  $2.12/oz (can't beat this price for a daily tea).<br /><br />Liquid Jade (3 stars) was an O.K. tea, ever-so-slightly more bitter than the other two I taste tested, and almost a chalky feeling (perhaps it was ground into larger particles than the other teas).  Yes it's organic, always a plus, but at a cost of $6.15/oz, no way will I buy this again when I can get TeaZone 4 stars for a third this cost, and Serendipi Tea 5 stars for significantly less money as well.

Ok, first of all, I mention the licorice part because, well, if you know your herbs, licorice is also good for heart burn, but has the side effect of being a mild laxative.

But the tea is more effective for me--I think my body absorbs it better in a natural form, which is normal for vitamins).

       " 'Earl Grey is my favorite blend of tea by far - no competition there. The biggest secret with this tea once given to Earl Grey of Hoswick Hall (British Prime Minister in 1830 - 1834) by a Chinese manadarin, reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life, is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil, a rather intense, tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange (which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange; the latter is native to South Vietnam, and its oil was probably the recipe\\'s original ingredient). Using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea\\'s natural flavor - but with Twinings you just can\\'t go wrong, because the original Earl Grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his Chinese friend.<br /><br />(From the Twinings website: \"When the mandarin\\'s tasty gift began to run out, Earl Grey asked his tea merchants, Twinings, to match it for him. Twinings unique blend was the Grey family\\'s long-standing favourite. When guests inquired about it, they were directed to Twinings on the Strand, where they would ask for Earl Grey\\'s tea by name.\")<br /><br />Unless you insist on having *all* your tea with cream or milk, I recommend having this one without any kind of milk products: not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition; in my mind it just plain ruins the blend\\'s particular flavor.

Luckily for me, the taste was NOT like other organic sweets on the market, and that is a good thing.

The outer cookie has a good crunch and texture that holds up well and doesn't crumble. There is no such thing as a healthy cookie, but if you get an occasional sweet tooth, these cookies are a great way to satiate that tooth without completely blowing your diet, and are organic to boot.<br /><br />There is no taste, smell or look of green tea in these cookies, you would never know they had green tea if it wasn't for the label.

I bought Matcha that is from (or claims to be) from Japan and is called \"drinking grade\". This is a brighter, healthy looking green as opposed to this Taiwanese green tea. Or, the Taiwanese tea is made from different leaves, and not the ones that Matcha is traditionally made out of. Or, the other Matcha is simply a higher grade. Not that high though, as I am aware top notch Matcha is a very very bright green.<br /><br />However, this Taiwanese green tea is great. It keeps me up and 1 teaspoon is enough, or even half. I tried 2 teaspoons (morning and lunch) and I was up all night, so this stuff is real haha. I\\'d drink just 1 teaspoon for the morning or a 1/2 teaspoon in the morning and another 1/2 during lunch (I personally don\\'t have time for that). Not disregarding the product at all, I love it.

Put this in some orange juice and that will be your energy drink for the day, and it lasts a very long time.<br /><br />Oh and I paid 45 dollars for 150g of the other Matcha.

       " 'I have enjoyed Twinings teas for, oh, more than 20 years now. I was immediately suspicious of this new blend, if only because Twinings seemed to be attempting to capitalize on people\\'s renewed appreciation for the tradition of afternoon tea. Too often, especially in America, this meal is referred to as \"high tea\" to make it sound like a fancy event, even though high tea and afternoon tea differ in ways that have nothing to do with elegance. English Afternoon Tea sounded a little quaint, and Twinings already offers so many varieties of tea that it was hard to believe there could be anything new that would be worthwhile.<br /><br />As it happens, this tea is my new favorite. It doesn\\'t have the dainty flavorings or fragrance of Earl Grey or Lady Grey, my former favorites, nor does it contain the thundering levels of caffeine in English or Irish Breakfast Tea. Instead, it includes elements from both ends of the spectrum. Like the Lady and the Earl, it has little enough caffeine that I can toss back cup after cup without getting jumpy. And like the breakfast teas, it has more of a bold black-tea edge that in this case isn\\'t masked by bergamot or citrus notes. But with English Afternoon Tea, this edge is mellower and more refined than in the breakfast teas. It has more interest and character than a simple orange pekoe (the baseline for black tea) but without resorting to bitter or acerbic flavors.<br /><br />Any tea drinker should enjoy English Afternoon Tea. It\\'s surprisingly good, and despite the name, it\\'s a fine way to start the day. I only wonder why Twinings didn\\'t come up with it sooner!<br /><br />One final thought: Adding a little milk to tea--never cream, although at afternoon tea, it\\'s properly called cream--causes the tannins in the tea to attack the milk proteins. As a result, the tannins are neutralized and won\\'t attack your tongue. What this means for you is that the tea will cause less of the dry, mouth-puckering sensation you might have encountered eating walnuts or drinking dry red wine. If you\\'ve never tried milk in your tea, I recommend adding just a little.<br /><br />For a fascinating little blurb about how tea led to urbanization (who knew?), click here.

If you do decide to sweeten it, I would recommend something simple, such as raw sugar or a half packet of Splenda.  Anything more aggressive would probably ruin the taste of this tea; definitely don\\'t use a creamer.<br /><br />The chocolate and vanilla flavor is pretty complex, especially for a bagged tea.

Yes, that's what I said, turn it over. The paste will stick in the bowl, and the developing sulfurous gases that make wasabi hot, hot, hot are retained, improving the bite. Get that wasabi buzz. <p>I like to use it in tuna with wasabi-potato crust. Or being short on time, I just grill some yellowtail and mix a wasabi-sugar-soy sauce glaze and brush it on at the end of the grilling. Hot and sweet. Another totally bizarre but quite normal Japanese dish is wasabi nori chazuke, or tea-rice. Get some leftover rice warmed up in a bowl, put a dab of wasabi and a sprinkle of sushi nori strips.

This Green Tea is a blend of Japanese Green Teas, which are more robust and flavourful than typical Chinese Greens. The only Green Tea I've tasted that compares is straight Yama Moto Yama from Japan. I believe Yama Moto Yama is also in the Stash blend.<br /><br />As far as Green Teas go, this blend is among the naturally sweetest and has no bitterness... unless you overcook it. The trick I have found to getting the best flavour from Green Teas is not using too high a temperature to steep it. Steep at a lower temp (170F-180F) for a longer time which will result in a tea that is actually green in colour, not brown or gold. Also, this tea tastes best as is, don't put any sweeteners in it like sugar or honey. If you are addicted to sugar, ween yourself off of it and enjoy the great flavour of this premier Green Tea.<br /><br />Of course, Green Tea is incredibly healthy, rich in anti-oxidants and relaxing theanine, is not harmfully acidic like coffee and there is also one quarter the amount of caffiene than in coffee - easier to brew too!<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable considering the quality of tea you are getting. Better yet, buy it in bulk for great savings.<br /><br />If you want to be even healthier, Stash also sells their Premium Green Tea in organic form for only a few more pennies per bag.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!\",\n",

The glowing reviews here sealed my decision...but alas, I sadly haven't found this to be as wonderful as they did. I find this tea to be pretty bland no matter how little or long I steep it, and there's barely a trace of either mint to be detected.

Before I found this kind, I would choke down regular green (which tastes like hay!) and tried all of the flavored kinds.  Most of the teas would hurt my stomach if I drank them in the morning on an empty stomach.  Moroccon mint doesn't bother my tummy at all.  In fact, If I have an upset stomach or feel really full, this tea actually calms it.  I drink two talls of this tea a day.  I am thirty years old, but I hear everyday that I look like I am in my early 20's.  People quite literally don't believe that I am 30.

Tapioca requires a much longer cooking time than advertised, and also, despite them having a fairly high sugar content naturally, in order to give them that sweet, syrupy taste you get from the stores, you'll have to coat and/or cook them in a boat load of sugar (a mixture of brown/white sugar will do, I prefer to use agave nectar personally).

For a week I was nursing constantly, pumping and drinking over a gallon of water a day to increase my supply, with increased frustration being the only result.

Then I dunk the tea bag 15 or so times and then gently squeeze it to extract every last bit.  When I tried my first cup, I hated it.  It tasted like musty, minty licorice.  I have a sensitive stomach so I thought there was no way I'd be able to drink it.  Adding honey didn't help but just a bit of sugar made it taste okay.  My second cup was a little bit better and by the third cup, I genuinely liked the taste of it!

Yerba Mate is made from a holly tree that grows in the South American Rainforest and the native people have been drinking it for centuries. In fact the natives call it the \"drink of the gods.\" Mate contains a cousin of caffeine that many have dubbed \"mateine\" which wakes you mentally without all the negative side effects that caffeine has. It doesn\\'t give you the jitters, or an upset stomach, or the sweats. It just gives your brain a little energy boost slowly but very effectively.

Their tea bag tags have metaphysical sayings on them like, \"Your breath is the voice of your soul\" and \"Your head must bow to your heart\".<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea\\'s benefits: \"Kava Stress Relief tea helps you calm down as it relieves stress, anxiety and minor pain, as well as lending gentle support to the digestion and the kidneys. A member of the peppercorn family, Kava (Piper methysticum) is a highly prized medicinal and beverage plant, whose primary benefit is alleviating anxiety. \"Kava-kava,\" native to Oceania and the South Pacific Islands, has been used and cultivated for its ability to calm the body and mind, and encourage a good night\\'s sleep. A powerful antispasmodic, this herb promotes a state of \"relaxed unconcern\" while compromising neither mental functions nor clarity of thought when used appropriately. Furthermore, Kava has been shown to relax the uterus and relieve menstrual cramps and minor menopausal symptoms.* The Herb Research Foundation (2000) indicates that scientific data supports the use of kava for minor anxiety, stress, restlessness, muscle tension and mild pain. For added flavor, our formula has been complemented with Stevia, Sarsaparilla and Organic Carob. Enjoy a warm soothing cup of Kava Stress Relief, a delicious way to relax.\"<br /><br />In addition to the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease, there is a warning on the box, \"Ask a healthcare professional before use if you have or have had liver problems, frequently use alcoholic beverages, or are taking any medication. Stop use and see a doctor if you develop symptoms that may signal liver problems (e.g., unexplained fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, fever, vomiting, dark urine, pale stools, yellow eyes or skin). Not for use by persons under 18 years of age, or by pregnant or breastfeeding women. Not for use with alcoholic beverages. Excessive use, or use with products that cause drowsiness, may impair your ability to operate a vehicle or heavy equipment.\"<br /><br />Note that the media scare about kava several years ago was not for the kava root, and it is my opinion that based on my own research that kava is very safe. However, I am not a physician, and if you have any health concerns, you should check with an appropriate professional.<br /><br />I decided to give Kava Stress Relief Tea four stars since it didn\\'t really work for me.

(E.g., it also makes for great iced tea in summer; particularly if you add a bit of lemon.)<br /><br />If you\\'re making more than a single cup of tea, and unless you like your tea *very* weak, you may want to rethink the company\\'s measuring directions - based on the the \"one bag per cup\" ratio, you\\'ll likely need two or more bags for an entire pot (depending on size), even when steeping an extra minute or two.

I was initially a fan of English Breakfast tea, but was introduced to Irish Breakfast tea some time back.  A slightly thicker liquor produced than does English Breakfast, it mixes well with a variety of items (sugar and milk are recommended, but certain alcoholic bases or mixers sit quite nicely if you want to switch up the classic Hot Toddy concept or use Kahlua instead of sugar), and has an even stronger aroma and flavor than your regular black tea.<br /><br />If you're a fan of weaker brews where one or two dunks is good enough, this is not for you.  I tend to steep this for a long while (tea experts would call me nuts for doing this as it could scald and alter the flavor of the leaves), but I love the strength of the brew afterwards.  This is great to have on-the-go, too, and hearty to drink if you're ill and require a lot of liquids.\",\n",

Try making a pitcher of tea with half green tea and half black tea.

       " 'If classic chai is your cup of tea, I don\\'t think you\\'ll find one better than Rishi\\'s. My suggestion is to prepare it in the traditional manner, i.e., for every 1 - 1.5 tablespoons of chai, use 1/2 cup of whole milk, 3/4 cup of water, and 1.5 tablespoons of white sugar. Bring the chai and liquids to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for five minutes; I add the sugar after straining (it\\'s supposed to be very sweet; add less if you like). It\\'s really a yummy pick-me-up.<br />Rishi makes a number of organic chai blends, none of which, unfortunately, are available from Amazon at the time of this writing. I\\'m now going to make a confession: as good as Organic Masala Chai is, I actually prefer the other blends, all of which I prepare in the aforementioned classic manner.<br />One is called Maghreb Mint; it has a green rather than black tea base, and as its name indicates, is spiced differently from a classic chai. This one also tastes best sweetened with white sugar and is delicious. However, I drink a LOT of really fine tea (much of it from Rishi) that should be drunk \"straight up,\" hence I\\'d rather have my chai \"tea-free\" (a contradiction in terms, I realize). My two absolute favorites are Rishi\\'s rooibos-based chai blends: one is called Rooibos Chai and the other, confusingly enough, Rooibos Chai Caffeine-Free. Since neither of these blends contain (as far as I can tell) caffeine, the choice of names is unfortunate [UPDATE: these have since been renamed \"Rooibos Chai\" and \"West Cape Chai,\" respectively and are both caffeine-free]. The one not designated caffeine-free contains something called \"ramon nut\" which adds a lovely, chocolatey flavor, and which is also an ingredient in another caffeine-free Rishi offering called Rainforest Chai which I also like but which some might find too peppery. These both, I find, taste better sweetened with honey or Volcanic Nectar blue agave nectar rather than sugar.<br />All of the Rishi chais can be found at Whole Foods or direct from Rishi. With any luck, Rishi will start packaging some of these other blends in canisters and Amazon will carry them; they\\'re wonderful!',\n",

After using them up, I decided to try the Earl Grey from Twinings for K-cups but was disappointed. The flavor was quite weak, not to say everyone likes a strong tea, but those who enjoy the sophisticated taste of Earl Grey, often like it to have a bolder taste then what this produced. Also it left a lot of unpleasant tea powder at the bottom of the tea cup which gave the cup of tea an unappealing appearance of being dirty.<br /><br />I would have just assumed that this was the best a Keurig maker could do to produce a cup of tea if I hadn't already had 2 boxes of Celestial Seasoning teas that produced stronger tea with no muddy appearance.

There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a \"premium\" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.

       " 'So I grew up in a townhouse complex with my two best friends being Thai and Indian 1st gen immigrants... I grew up with about a fourth of my food being from their homes--we went to whoever was making the best food. Thai tea was a bit of a guilty obsession for us, especially in the summer. As I got older, the addiction grew, and I\\'ve brewed hundreds of gallons of it. That said, I bought this along with the Por Kwan when I couldn\\'t get to my Asian market. The Por Kwan was much better, but neither was especially great; this one is GREEN tea, which Thai tea is NEVER supposed to be. The leaf quality is pretty awful--really dusty, the stems are ground in with the leaves (big no no, clearly cheaply made), and it\\'s DEFINITELY been treated beyond the red dye--which our tea FROM Thailand and Sri Lanka actually didn\\'t need, though admittedly, they weren\\'t garfield orange, more like a pinkish peach, when the milk was added (when it\\'s brewed correctly, GOOD \"black\" teas will be a lovely red shade; this would likely be a gross putrid yellow-brown without the dye)...<br /><br />Some people probably add enough sugar to compensate for the chemicals in this, but I can\\'t get over it. I could steep it for 1 minute, 3, or 5 or 10 and it would still have a scent and flavor I (admittedly my sense of taste and smell are keen) am repulsed by--just opening the bag, the smell of a cheap plasticware factory\\'s toxic chemicals gently waved in my face like fresh paint. The bag has gone unused as a result... I\\'m about to toss it, since frankly, I can\\'t trust something I know has had things added to it that make that distinct \"not from nature\" smell and taste so apparent to me, someone who admittedly mostly buys things like Silk Road prize teas (Drunken Concubine for example) from Angelina\\'s--the only guy I\\'ve personally met who knows quite a lot more about tea than me is there, and he used to evaluate them all over China/Asia and gets the very best... Those chemicals, if you care, are probably a mix of intended additives and byproduct. They intentionally tend to add things likely mold/mildew inhibitors since transporting in Asia equals humidity (most of this is from China, shipped to Thailand sometimes or tagged product of Thailand if the company is in Bangkok, regardless of where the tea came from or how many factories were involved in its creation), along with the obvious pesticides in these cheaper teas. Then you have the reason this stuff is so cheap when good tea will typically be--even loose--$1-4 an OUNCE: the manufacturing process. I\\'m pretty sure this wasn\\'t made in an especially clean plant, and that smell in opening the bag reminded me of places that just don\\'t exist in America, places that remind me of why I DO buy USA goods 99% of the time. The water used to clean, the grinders... none are going to be especially clean by our standards, and much gets recycled, as water is costly in other parts of the world. The short reason I won\\'t finish this or give it to anyone else is that all of that non-tea gets brewed right into the tea and goes into your body. I like my body AND tea too much to settle for less than great. The por kwan brand is much better, but... it\\'s still not the bee\\'s knees. Still, if I had to pick one, it is NOT this one. The other I can say at least most people should be okay with... I\\'d give IT a 3.5. I give this a 2 for MOST people to be fair since face it, most don\\'t care about the nitpicking I am hyperaware of. Most don\\'t teach medical sciences and work directly with ill patients, either, for a living, so most aren\\'t constantly immersed in healthcare.<br /><br />Whatever you get, I\\'ll at least give this recommendation: we grew up using sweetened condensed milk--it\\'s how they typically do it in Thailand, where fresh cow milk is expensive, very expensive--or sometimes evaporated in a pinch; the condensed really makes the texture best for adding ice; otherwise, it becomes extremely thin, which is a sad reality of many restaurants, which I\\'m presuming a lot of people base their reviews on; high quality Thai restaurants--and they DO exist(expensive doesn\\'t mean high quality)--the ones Thai folks eat at--won\\'t skimp on this detail, let alone use regular milk. Half and half *can* be a feasible option, but it\\'s just not the same.',\n",
       " 'Isn\\'t it odd the weight and power that one bad review can have?<br /><br />I LOVE Thai Iced Tea but the nearest place was a thai restaurant I would have to order a meal from in order to get the tea. Even then, the allure of the tea would draw me to order somewhat mediocre food. Suffice it to say, I was looking for a way to make it on my own.<br /><br />I came across this tea (and various other brands) and it was looking promising except that one bad review relating to Green Tea. I second-guessed a potential purchase so much because of that one review.<br /><br />Finally I took the plunge and I couldn\\'t be happier. It tastes exactly like it does from the various sources i\\'ve tried it from. Maybe Thai Iced Tea isn\\'t supposed to have green tea, I\\'m not sure. I don\\'t position myself on internet forums as an expert in tea. I DO know however that if it looks like thai iced tea, it smells like thai iced tea, and it tastes like thai iced tea, then for all intents and purposes it IS thai iced tea. Besides, green tea leaves are probably better for you anyways.<br /><br />Don\\'t let this one negative review turn you off like it almost did to me.<br /><br />Now on to other matters:<br /><br />The quantity the package calls for is really too much. I make the tea in 64 oz. quantities and it only takes 4 tbsp. or so. I boil the water with the tea inside until it reaches a rolling boil, then I allow it to steep for 4-5 minutes. I was using the stainless steel muslin filter another reviewer mentioned, but unfortunately it was getting really groady looking and it was hard to dry as a college student. I\\'ve now invested in T-Sac tea filters, size #3.<br /><br />There is some \"dustiness\" to the tea. When I first started drinking it, I never noticed it until I got to the last 4-5 oz. or so in the pitcher since the dust sinks to the bottom. Now when i transfer the tea to the pitcher I just dont pour the last few oz. into the pitcher which effectively gets rid of any issues with tea dust.<br /><br />I mix the tea with milk and/or coffee creamer (original non-fat works splendidly) though i always use coffee creamer if I have it on hand.<br /><br />There is ONE problem. If you really liked thai iced tea before, there\\'s a chance you\\'re going to get addicted to it. I have a reusable 24 oz. iced drink tumbler and it\\'s easy to fill that up a couple of times a day or more if drank with meals. with 2.5 of these cups you\\'re looking at 64 oz. of thai iced tea a day if you\\'re not careful. With that being said i\\'d much rather drink 40-50 oz. of thai iced tea than the 30-60 oz. of iced coffee with (regular i.e. with fat) cream, sugar, and caramel flavoring.<br /><br />It\\'s a great alternative to coffee and I couldn\\'t be happier.',\n",

Stir with a long spoon...(careful it will be HOT) until the water is completely clear. It\\'s what we call a SIMPLE SYRUP down south. Before you brew your K-Cup, drop a splash of simple syurp in your glass or over your ice. The Sweet Perfect Ice Tea will then truely be PERFECT! FYI: If you live up north like I do and crave ice tea all year round...You\\'d better stock up on your K-cups by end of summer.

       " 'Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the \"green pearl\" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area\\'s gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself \"home of silk and tea\" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name \"gunpowder\" derives from the tea\\'s elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream.',\n",

       " 'I recently took up drinking tea, green and white to be exact. As a newbie I started off with the commercial stuff like Lipton and Celestial Seasonings with pure tea bags. The taste was ok but In all honestly it didn\\'t do anything for me. I began doing a bit of research and found that loose leaf tea was more potent and flavorful due to the fact that they use whole leaves rather than the \"dust\" leftover they use in tea bags. A bit more research brought me to Japanese green tea which recognized as the best of green teas in the world. I started off drinking Traditional Medicinals Japanese Bancha, then I started drinking their roasted Hojicha. While a bit better than your average Lipton Tea, I knew tea could be better. I started using loose leaf Sencha which was great and before long I came upon drinking Matcha. Matcha is great but it is frothy and mainly comes in powdered form for shakes, desserts or ice cream.<br />Gyokuro on the other hand is the REAL DEAL. This stuff is truly what a green tea is all about. Very dark greenish bluish color with a strong pleasant aroma. The taste is pure and fresh and simply tastes like \"green tea\" and not grass. It only takes about 90 seconds steeping time and the brewing temperature just under boiling point. The color of the tea is a very bright clean looking green which tastes as good as it looks. I dare you to open a tea bag of Lipton, Traditional Medicinals or even loose leaf Sencha and compare alongside Gyokuro. You will laugh as the others look like trash compared to Gyokuro, I kid you not.

I can see why some people order this product, thinking that they are getting the Maccha powder (the one for the tea ceremony).  This is NOT a 100% Maccha poder.  It is a delicious, fresh green tea blended with maccha powder.<br /><br />Quick Tip<br /><br />If your green tea tastes too bitter, the water might be too hot.  The best temperature is around 80C (176F- NOT boiling hot). After pouring the hot water, steep about 30-45 sec, then take the bag out.  You never want to \"cook\" the green tea.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)',\n",

That\\'s because it is made by Ito En, Japan\\'s leading tea distributor and one of the country\\'s largest beverage manufacturers. I was surprised to hear of staff members at the Japanese Embassy in DC drinking this tea. It comes highly recommended from a Japanese friend working there.<br /><br />Made from 100% Japan-grown tea, this product also contains \"matcha\", a finely powdered high grade green tea. It\\'s responsible for the lively green color. The pyramidal nylon bag lets water pass through better, so you get more flavor out of each serving than with traditional flat tea bags.<br /><br />Brewing temperatures for different kinds of tea vary, but to make green tea, the water should be between 70-80Â°C, not boiling. With half the caffeine, green tea is better for you than black tea because of the higher concentration of water-soluble antioxidants (cathechins and flavinoids) and vitamin C, which are destroyed by the roasting process. One cup will give you 100%+ of your daily USRDA requirement. Green tea is also great chilled or over ice.',\n",

I will no longer be needing to purchase this supplement. This also is a tea that has very little caffeine and it did not make me nervous like the average teas do.<br />I do recommend this tea to everyone especially if you have any of these problems, but for me I enjoyed a very restful day without any jitters.<br /><br />As for the cost, this morning I cut off 2 grams of the tea and I am just finishing it, you can brew this tea many many times as you can see in the video, this makes it, for me, a very inexpensive tea.

       " 'This product is called \"Hunmatsu-RyokuCha,\" in Japanese, and not the same as \"Maccha\" or \"Matcha.\"<br />The translation for Hunmatsu Ryokucha and Maccha are actually the same, green tea powder.<br />However, the ingredient for Maccha is a special kind of tea called \"Tencha,\" in Japanese, and has unique \"Umami.\"<br />\"Tencha\" is grown in the shade in order to prevent the final product from developing certain astringent bitterness, called \"Shibumi,\" in Japanese.  There are many kinds of bitterness.  i.e. For Maccha, it is not necessary true that bitterness is bad.  Actually, the first grade Maccha is more bitter than the low grade Maccha, given you are comparing amongst REAL Maccha powder.<br /><br />The process of producing REAL Maccha is much more complicated and painstaking than Hunmatsu-Ryokucha.<br />Hunmatsu-Ryokucha is ground regular Sencha Green Tea that are casually served all over Japan in regular household.  (Sorry, I am struggling with English.)  But one must understand that the kind of tea plants, the way they grow the tea plants, the way they process the tea leaves, are all different, not only in Japan, but also in any countries.<br /><br />(If you can read Chinese Characters...) Hunmatsu-Ryokucha consists of 4 Chinese Characters, Hunmatsu means powder, Ryokucha means green tea; however, Maccha sonsists of two Chinese Characters.  Maccha means special green tea powder intended for tea ceremony.  And we, Japanese, don\\'t drink Maccha regularly.  Most Japanese don\\'t know a lot about tea ceremony either.  (As most Japanese are not martial artists....)<br /><br />In the United States, Asian Grocery Store sells both Hunmatu Ryokucha and Maccha.  The real Maccha is usually in a nice tiny tin can, and the amount included is about 28g (about 1 oz), priced about 9 - 10 dollars each.  I don\\'t think that any country but Japan produces Maccha, but I might be wrong.  However, if the green tea powder is produced in Taiwan, China, Korea,and other Asian countries, it is most likely to be Hunmatsu Ryokucha, NOT Maccha.  The same product sold at this vendor is much cheaper at Asian Grocery Store since you don\\'t have to pay for S/H.<br /><br />The advantage of Hunmatsu-Ryokucha over Maccha is that the former has higher nutritional value, which I don\\'t want to discuss in this site.  But the cancer preventing effect in this cheap powder is higher than more expensive Maccha.<br /><br />The disadvantage of Hunmatsu-Ryokucha over Maccha is of course, \"Shibumi\" (the closest direct translation is astringency.)  That\\'s why you may feel it is more bitter than Maccha.  The powder is probably coarser than the Maccha.<br /><br />You may use Hunmatsu-Ryokucha for baking and dessert making, in the same way as you use Maccha. But the flavor and taste are definitely different.<br /><br />I have not tried Starbucks Maccha Latte.  But I assume that they use the low grade Maccha powder since, amongst real Maccha, the low grade Maccha is less bitter than the premium quality Maccha for tea ceremony, I heard.<br /><br />To conclude, if your purpose is to enjoy REAL Maccha flavor, you should not purchase this product.<br />But if your purpose is simply for your health, this product is better than Maccha.  However, you should research availability and cost comparisons of Hunmatsu-Ryokucha products by actually going to the Asian Grocery Stores.  You may get better price than this.  (Actually, I am pretty sure that you get better prices locally.)  Most Vietnamese owned grocery stores have Hunmatsu-Ryokucha in stock, not to mention Japanese and Korean owned grocers.<br /><br />Also, Hunmatsu-Ryokucha is popular in Japan, too.  Thus not all green tea powder imported from Japan is \"Maccha.\"<br /><br />If you want to buy the quality Maccha, you should find the Japanese Grocery Store (owened by Japanese) and ask specifically \"Maccha\" for tea ceremony.  And if you are not satisfied, sign up for tea ceremony class taught by a tea ceremony master.<br /><br />For the seller, one must not include \"Matcha\" or \"Maccha\" in the descriptions or titles, if the product was just \"Hunmatsu-Ryokucha.\"  As I wrote earlier, these two products share the same English Translation.  So you can say, this is green tea powder, grounded green tea, powdered green tea.  However, you must not even hint this is the same green tea powder that can be used for the formal Japanese tea ceremony.  Simply, if you call this \"Maccha\" or \"Matcha,\" you are lying.  And you can be actually sued, and you will lose.  Not only this seller, but I find many sellers are falsely including \"Matccha\" or \"Matcha\" for non-MATCHA GREEN TEA POWDER.  So I believe this is just the innocent mistake.  I encourage the sellers to correct their mistakes, though.',\n",

A generous teaspoon of Lapsang Souchong steeped for about three and a half minutes in roughly 190-200 degree water will yield a strong, flavorful cup of the Fujian Province's most notable tea.

The recipe is complemented with Organic Spearmint, which can help to relax the body and aid digestion; Organic Licorice Root, to support the adrenals and enhance the effects of other healing herbs; and Dong Quai Root, a well-known tonic.

The biggest secret with this tea once given to Earl Grey of Hoswick Hall (British Prime Minister in 1830 - 1834) by a Chinese manadarin, reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life, is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil, a rather intense, tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange (which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange; the latter is native to South Vietnam, and its oil was probably the recipe\\'s original ingredient). Using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea\\'s natural flavor - but with Twinings you just can\\'t go wrong, because the original Earl Grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his Chinese friend.<br /><br />(From the Twinings website: \"When the mandarin\\'s tasty gift began to run out, Earl Grey asked his tea merchants, Twinings, to match it for him. Twinings unique blend was the Grey family\\'s long-standing favourite. When guests inquired about it, they were directed to Twinings on the Strand, where they would ask for Earl Grey\\'s tea by name.\")<br /><br />Unless you insist on having *all* your tea with cream or milk, I recommend having this one without any kind of milk products: not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition; in my mind it just plain ruins the blend\\'s particular flavor. (But that\\'s just me, of course.) Whichever way you have it, though, if scented teas are your kind of thing, Twinings Earl Grey should be right up your alley.  Just be careful not to oversteep it: only an exceptionally forgiving tea like, for example, Yunnan, will not turn flat and bitter that way; and with any decent Earl Grey, 2 - 3 minutes should be plenty of steeping time (with Twinings it certainly is).',\n",

       " '*****<br />This Fasting Tea from Yogi Tea for Weight Loss Support is \"designed to promote healthy functioning of the stomach and intestines, and to help you feel more energetic while you lose weight.\" Fasting Tea is based on an Ayurvedic formula---Ayurveda is an Indian form of health care now also becoming popular in the United States.<br /><br />It\\'s suggested that you drink Fasting Tea 15 minutes before eating. I have done this, and it does really seem to help, although I\\'m not quite sure if the effect is physiological or psychological. Oh, well, I don\\'t care, since it helps me to be in control of my eating. It has a sweet and pleasing taste, and is quite enjoyable to sip on while others are filling up on bread, appetizers, and high-calorie drinks and alcohol.<br /><br />I am impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Fasting Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it\\'s not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea\\'s benefits: \"Fasting is made with organic Red Clover and Garcinia Fruit designed to help support a healthy weight loss program, as it aids digestive functions, supports the metabolism and encourages internal cleansing. The tea includes hydroxy-citric acid that is found in the Garcinia Fruit, native to Southeast Asia. This naturally occurring substance has been shown to simultaneously suppress the appetite, help reduce fats and cholesterol in the liver and disrupt the process by which the body stores excess calories as fat. We have also included the warming herbs Fennel Seed, Cinnamon Bark and Black Pepper to help promote circulation, as well as Red Clover, which works as a tonic and a blood purifier. The recipe is complimented with Alfalfa Leaf, Indian Bacopa Leaf (Gotu Kola), and English Hawthorn Berry, all of which can aid the body in the elimination of wastes that are known to slow the metabolism. Finally, we\\'ve included Burdock, Dandelion and Yellow Dock Roots, all used by European herbalists for centuries to support the liver in eliminating toxins.\" Other ingredients in this tea are Licorice Root, Alfalfa Leaf, Cardamom Seed, Ginger Root, Clove Bud, Barley Malt, Date Powder, Natural Plum Flavor, and Natural Passion Fruit Flavor. Almost every ingredient in this tea is also organic.<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Fasting Tea contains no caffeine whatsoever. It steeps for 5-10 minutes, a nice long time, but I find that I only need one tea bag instead of two for a wonderful flavor.<br /><br />I really like this tea, and it is very health-promoting.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br />*****',\n",

       " 'My first tea from Dilmah, it has fairly typical Ceylon (Sri Lanka) flavor, but is quite a bit more robust and flavorful  than the typical mass produced black teas.  I\\'m guessing the grade of this tea is BOP (broken orange pekoe), not whole leaves, but a good grade or so above what you get in teabags. Still, it steeps quite quickly, and a little bit goes a long way.  It has a fresh, rich flavor, not necessarily complex, but full bodied and well balanced with a touch of acidity along with the maltiness and astringency that is typical of black teas of this kind.  It is somewhat individualistic, though, probably due to it being a single origin tea rather than a blend.  A word that comes to mind is \"flavoury,\" sometimes applied to Sri Lankan teas.  The description on the side of the tin says it\\'s \"a medium tannin tea with pronounced woody flavours and a medium length finish.\"<br /><br />In steeping, I use a Teeli permanent filter to allow room for the leaves to expand, and throw away a first quick rinse of the tea before steeping a cup to drink.  Rinsing the tea makes it mellower and less astringent.  A relatively short steeping time of a minute or two is all that is necessary.<br /><br />One correction needed in the description is that there is no foil pouch in the tin, but there is an inner lid, and each tin comes individually shrink wrapped, which probably helps the tea remain fresh.  Considering how little tea you need to make a cup or pot, you get a pretty good deal here with three tins.',\n",

The suggested brewing times remain the same (3 - 4 minutes), but the amount of leaf has TRIPLED to one tablespoon and the suggested brewing temperature has decreased by 10Âº to 180Âº.

A higher concentration of scented leaf would likely gag me (as in the case of the brewing instructions for Rishi\\'s Osthmanthus Silver Needle), plus the original instructions are MUCH more cost-effective. Tea preferences, however, are very much a matter of taste, so play with the suggested parameters, if you\\'re so inclined, to determine yours.

Originating with the small-time, private, mid-19th century plantations of a British civil surgeon named Dr. Campbell, tea has long since transformed the region into a major economic center, with over 80 running gardens producing over 10 million kgs (over 22 million lbs) of tea on a total area of almost 20,000 hectares (approximately 75 square miles), and employing over 50,000 people on a permanent basis, with a further 15,000 being hired during the plucking season (March - November). The area\\'s natural climate with its mixture of rainfall, sunshine and rich soil makes for a very distinctive flavor, and to be called \"Darjeeling,\" tea must have been grown and processed in that particular region.<br /><br />Darjeeling tea comes in several harvest varieties or \"flushes\": the lighter Easter harvest or first flush, and the stronger Spring harvest or second flush, which has an unmistakeably fruity, Muscatel-like note. (There is also a Summer harvest or third flush, which is even stronger than the tea from the second harvest, but it is somewhat less refined and therefore less popular than the first two varieties.)<br /><br />This particular tea from Milikthong Estate is about as refined as you can get when it comes to Darjeelings (and hence, to tea culture in general): an exquisite, highly aromatic single-estate Finest Tippy Golden Flowery Orange Pekoe (FTGFOP), i.e. a tea of the much sought-after, supreme whole leaf grade containing a particularly high content of delicate, quick-steeping, golden-orange \"tips,\" the very ends of the bud\\'s leaves, which constitute a guarantee of quality. (The higher the content of tips, the higher the quality; and to qualify as FTGFOP, a tea must have a particularly high portion of tips.)  The addition of the number \"1\" designates it as one of the finest in its category.<br /><br />This is a tea for truly special occasions ... for a treat, there\\'s hardly anything better than a cup of this, a good book (or a good conversation) and a plate of scones or other little afternoon tea cakes.

I usually drink very strong tea with sugar, no milk. But this truly rare Assam is a pleasure to drink also w/o sugar added. As I tried many different Assams in the past, I had a negative prejudice to the Assam teas (many of the Assams in the past were Chinese though, I guess). Because of the high price, I decided to take a risk - and was rewarded. I do hope that the next batch will be as good as the current one. My spouse is having a cup of tea every morning (the Revolution English Breakfast), I am confident she will like this rare Assam. The only problem here is its price. I may have hard time to keep on buying the Assam from India on a regular basis. Well, X-mas is coming soon. I might survive with the Special Rare Ceylon.

       " 'This morning I reviewed 2 ORGANIC matcha teas, side by side:<br /><br />1.  The first one was: \"2nd harvest Organic Domatcha\" tea that I purchased at a local farmer\\'s market, and I paid $37.99 for this 2.82 oz tin. Result = 4.5 stars (greatest taste and foam, organic, very expensive)<br /><br />2,  The second one was \"SerendipiTea matcha culinary grade organic green tea\" which I ordered on amazon.com, paying only $17.99 for a whopping 4 oz. bag. (twice as much for half the price).  Result = 5 stars (great taste, good foam, organic, terrific cost)<br /><br />**NOTE: see another review of SerendipiTea by me, beside 2 other brands.  It won in that review as well.<br /><br />I made the 2 cups identically, using soymilk and water 50/50, using the Blaney method (described below):<br /><br />\"Blaney\" Method for making Green Tea Latte:<br />You need 2 small sauce pans on a gas stovetop, latte foamer device, bamboo whisk, soymilk, water, teaspoon measure, Â½ cup measuare, and matcha powder.  (many prefer sweetener and I suggest Agave syrup but I did not use it in this test since I enjoy the pure unsweetened tea flavor.  Cheaper teas may require the sweetener to mask any fishy tastes, but not these two high quality brands.)<br /><br />1. Using the latte foamer device, please foam 1/2 cup (cold or tepid) soymilk, then heat it gently while stirring (this personal \"Blaney\" method of mine makes the best foam)<br />2. heat 1/2 cup water (in separate pan) til boiling<br />3. add 1 level tsp matcha to 1/2 c. heated water and wisk with bamboo wisk about 30 seconds in zig zag motion  until matcha powder is dissolved<br />4. add the heated, foamed soymilk to the matcha/water blend<br />5. pour this mix into latte device, pump 20 or so times, then pour entire foamed mixture into large mug.<br /><br />For this test I made the two teas simultaneously so the `foamed\\' structure would be nearly identical (one is supposed to drink the latte immediately before the foam dissipates). I did, however, rinse the items with filtered water before pumping the second tea, so as to not to contaminate #2 with #1.<br /><br />For photo of the 2 teas and boxes, see:  [...]<br />Result:<br /><br />>>>Taste and texture:<br />DoMatcha won for a (very slightly, barely noticeable)  cleaner taste, and better \\'foam\\'. However, the SerendipiTea was still very yummy.  I have the most sensitive taste buds on earth (other than my son) and I detected a very mild \"ocean\" taste with the Serindipitea, but I attribute that to the fact that my SerindipiTea had been opened a week prior.  The DoMatcha had only been opened the day before.  Newly opened teas always taste best. I would love to repeat this test in the future with two newly opened teas so that oxygen exposure won\\'t be a variable as it was here.<br />&lt;&lt;&lt;Price:<br />Well, the DoMatcha 2nd harvest organic costs 4 times more, and is only ever-so-slightly better, and if I re-test with two new, unopened packages, who knows? Maybe they will be the same.<br /><br /> I am giving the SerendipiTea organic  5 stars for being such a cost bargain, being organic, and tasting so great...  and I am giving  the DoMatcha 4.5 stars for also being organic and tasting great, even fantastic, but being such a high cost.<br /><br />Carol Blaney, Ph.D.',\n",
       " \"My first impression is not the initial taste on the tip of my tongue as first expected, but the powerful, almost peppery taste at the back of my throat as I sip this one down. On the second sipping, more on the tip of my tongue this time, the tea's more subtle qualities come through: the mellow side of the lemon and ginger combination--then wham again with the peppery snap at the back of my throat. This is no mildly flavored herbal, but one directly infused with ginger root, lemon peel, lemon grass and blackberry leaves. One other interesting ingredient is linden, a plant with many medicinal properties and used for such for many centuries. It would be interesting to know if it is the linden flower that is used (and most probably it was), since this is a diaphoretic, a very mild fever-inducing part of the plant when taken as a hot tea. This naturally enables the body to help fight off infections according to some sources I looked up on the web. Not to worry though--this is not a fever that will keep you from work! It's one that will make your body work for you instead.<br /><br />I bought this one for some relief from a sore throat and it definitely helps ease my sinus induced problem. As with any lemon-flavored beverage I've tried, it does leave a slight aftertaste of lemon, but not too strong or unpleasant. I imagine it would be quite good with honey, which I will definitely try once I get home from work. For now, a slight bit of sugar seemed to compliment the flavors nicely, even bringing them out more. This is a strong flavored herbal, not a mellow one as I've come to expect a lot of herbals to be. Drink with caution if you like your herbals on the softer side. This one's courting the wilder side of the tea experience.\",\n",
       " \"Although the advertising for this product was deceitful - it was advertised at $3.26 for 6 boxes and it turned out that it was $3.26 for only one box (shame on me for thinking I was getting a deal because someone was trying to rid themselves of too much of this tea). I received a refund from Amazon and the seller but there have still been some misrepresentation with the advertising that I have had to remind Amazon about with this. But because I have tried other teas by Triple Leaf (Dieter's Green Tea) that were successful, I thought I would try this one. After just 2 mugs of this tea, my blood pressure was back to normal. It was as high as 164/100 and now it's at 128/80. Although I do not recommend anyone to stop taking any medications without consulting their doctor, I do suggest incorporating this into your diet as an aid to help lower your blood pressure naturally. I have started to blend this tea with my regular sweet tea that I drink with my meals and that makes it easier to get in at least 2 glasses a day. I am now going to start buying it in bulk.\",\n",
       " 'These berries are thought to be one of the one of the healthiest natural foods. There are many \"stories\" about the amazing benefits of these berries, many of which may be true, but a few verifiable facts about them (in dried form) follow:<br /><br />1) High protein (about 12%), and are a complete protein. This is good for anybody, but particularly noteworthy to vegans, who choose not to get their protein from meats.<br /><br />2) Decent fiber content (about 10%)<br /><br />3) 18 (!!) amino acids<br /><br />4) Like most sweet fruits, high in carbs and calories. 100 grams give you about 350-380 calories; roughly 3/4 from carbs and 1/4 from fat.<br /><br />5) 6 vitamins, 8 amino acids, 11+ minerals (more in trace amounts)<br /><br />6) Carotenoids, unsaturated fatty acids (this is a good thing), phytosterols (help lower cholesterol), and other healthy (or theoretically healthy but not particularly well researched) phytochemicals.<br /><br />Enough with the technical jargon. These berries are great in cereal, smoothies (once hydrated), and tea. For tea, try this:<br /><br />Put water, a small number of berries (6-15ish) and a teabag in your cup, microwave for about a minute per teacup (time varies), drop a small amount in your favorite tea along with the teabag and let the berries and tea steep for about 3 minutes.<br /><br />This adds a subtle character to green tea (plus an unusual, tasty snack to do with a few of the sips). The flavor seems to blend well with chai and jasmine too. This may work differently for those who use creamer.<br /><br />I recommend that you try a bag, keeping in mind that you may need to soak the berries in water/tea/whatever in order to make them soft, and see what you think. I have found they make a great addition to my usual cereal-only breakfast because they give me a much-needed protein boost.<br /><br />If you like them quite a lot, you may want to take the time to look for a supply in a nearby Asian foods store. I have heard they can be purchased at a lower cost in bulk.',\n",

There were a number of green and dried leaves in the bag, which I never experienced with the \"other\" brand. I was about two-thirds of the way through my current bag when I discovered a couple of lovely little worms floating in my tea! FYI, I usually start my morning off with a big cup of hot tea, sweetened with gojis. After seeing the additional protein in my tea I decided to check the remaining contents of the bag. I emptied it out onto a white paper towel and discovered a number of more white worms. The bag has been kept sealed and stored in a dry, cool area so I blame the product not how it was stored.

After using them up, I decided to try the Earl Grey from Twinings for K-cups but was disappointed. The flavor was quite weak, not to say everyone likes a strong tea, but those who enjoy the sophisticated taste of Earl Grey, often like it to have a bolder taste then what this produced. Also it left a lot of unpleasant tea powder at the bottom of the tea cup which gave the cup of tea an unappealing appearance of being dirty.<br /><br />I would have just assumed that this was the best a Keurig maker could do to produce a cup of tea if I hadn't already had 2 boxes of Celestial Seasoning teas that produced stronger tea with no muddy appearance. I was quite surprised with this result because I ordered the Twinings tea with the assumption that it would be better then the Celestial Seasoning.<br /><br />Not my favorite K-cup tea for the Keurig.\",\n",

I don't do well on birth control; it makes me extremely unbearable to be around due to the intense mood swings it causes. But because I was in chronic pain from the Endometriosis I decided to try it. After three months I had to stop and find an alternative method because I wasn't handling the birth control well at all. This caused me to search for alternative/holistic methods to help ease the pain and regulate my periods. I read others reviews on this site and on fertility sites about the benefits of raspberry leaf tea. Since I use the Throat Coat from Traditional Medicinal which works wonders I trusted the brand completely.<br /><br />After I got off the birth control I started drinking this tea immediately, as directed and included Chaste Tree (VITEX) extract into each cup 2-3 times a day. I even steep it for the recommended 15 minutes to maximize the benefits. Since starting this I have reduced my periods from a standard super heavy flow for 7-8 days to a light-medium flow for 3.5-4 days (PLEASE NOTE HOW AMAZING THAT IS!) It started working right away on my very first period off the birth control but before I wrote a review to preach about it I waited another two cycles to see if it was consistent. It was! My periods are regular and the cramping has become less and less each month.<br /><br />Would I recommend this tea? ABSOLUTELY! If you have an issue with Endometriosis this could be an alternative to birth control pills and is something that I've found really helpful for reducing the length of my period and thus reducing the damaging effects that Endometriosis can cause.

I recommend this to any woman who suffers from PMS symptoms---mine are moderate to sometimes severe and I see a huge improvement when I drink it.  God provides.  It's heartening that there's a healthy alternative to prescription drugs, Midol, and birth control pills.  PMS is NOT 'all in your head' and this product is NOT 'a placebo effect'--I've seen both things recently written and it infuriates me.  You really have nothing to lose except your PMS symptoms, by trying this tea. I believe you can even order this by the box, if you don't want to buy the case.

I have been pain free for a month now and am moving around much more.<br /><br /> I saw my orthopedic surgeon for the first time in 2 years last week. He said there is no reason to operate since my knee has not deteriorated at all in the 2 year span and especially, if I am not in pain now. He said when I am unable to straighten my knee completely and /or am in a lot of pain, then it's time to operate. So for now, I'm continuing my regimen and sipping that Joint Comfort Tea all day long!! Thanks Amazon for keeping me in supply - it means a lot to me!!\",\n",
       " \"UPDATE:<br />It's been quite a qhile since I ordered my first box of Skin Detox tea, and have ordered it periodically since. I have the awful habit of using skin detox tea until my skin looks great, then not buying the tea for a while until I notice my skin becoming worse.<br />I have to say, that this tea has helped my skin quality in general mroe than any product that I have used. I have at times applied the tea topically as well for stronger effects, but it isn't neccessary for the tea to work. I've decided that i am going to actualyl keep myself in a constant supply of the tea, and drink it each day, as opposed to only after bad breakouts, to take a more proactive rather than reactive approach.<br /><br />Ad for the taste, I actually like it now. it took getting used to, but I find the taste calming and comforting now, as opposed to tolerable before.<br /><br />Anyway, if you have any hesitation whatsoever about tryig this tea for your skin, buy a box at the grocery store to try it out. I can almost guarantee that with regular use, though, your skin will improve.<br /><br />PRIOR REVIEW:<br />My first review, couldnt help myself!<br /><br />I heard some good things about this tea from a friend and decided that it couldnt hurt to order, as i am an avid tea-drinker anyway.<br /><br />Right before the tea arrived I began a horrendous breakout, the worst that I had had in years even. The entire left side of my face was covered in acne, perhaps a reaction from a new face-wash, that i since have been scared to touch!<br />Well a few days following the breakout the tea arrived. I figured there was no better situation really than this to try the tea so over the course of two weeks, besides general rinsing in the shower i have used no face wash, no creams or ointments, nothing. And my acne is almost gone!<br /><br />nothing new has popped up and everything that had been there is almost completely gone, i even notice acne scars fading if possible. my ance is literally drying up, as if i was using some sort of heavy cleanser or astringent, it is quite ridiculous. I am already looking at my budget to see if i have enough to order another batch.<br /><br />I used about 3 bags a day, one cup about midday with two tea bags, and one before bed with a single bag.<br /><br />The tea has a flavor that takes getting used to, both strong and weak at the same time, hard to explain. i don't use sugar so i don't know how it tastes with anything added.<br /><br />either way, it cant hurt so try it, i say!\",\n",
       " \"First off, I don't think there is anything wrong with the taste of this tea. It has a subtle fruity/berry flavor.

I do see a difference in my skin. It is more glowy and I haven't had a breakout since the first week of drinking the tea.  My husband has also commented on my skin so it must be working!!<br /><br />I would recommend this.  I will continue to purchase this even if I didn't get any results because it does taste really good!\",\n",

The taste is quite pleasant, and I am relieved to find that after many cups I am only enjoying it more.  The only reason I give it four stars is because of my probably unrealistic hope that my acne scars would dramatically disappear.  As it is, they are fading slowly but surely.  Maybe the tea has even sped up the process, but it is hard to tell since it is still too slow for me!  In any case, I definitely recommend this product.',\n",
       " \"I haven't had Thai tea in several years because the restaurants make it too sweet.  I purchased this one and a green tea version.  I had the green tea version and I developed a migraine that required medical treatment.  I totally missed that both teas contained FD&C Yellow 6 food coloring, also known as Sunset Yellow.  It is not listed on Amazon's description for this tea, but it is on the package if you look at the picture closely.  I later learned that it can have several potential health issues.  There have been calls for the withdrawal of Sunset Yellow from food use from the British Food Standards Agency.  The Center for Science in the Public Interest has requested the FDA ban it in the USA.  Sunset Yellow is banned in Norway and Finland.  I have gotten migraines from other artificial food additives, mostly artificial sweeteners and food preservatives.  I try to be careful, so I only blame myself.  I read every review, but didn't look at the photo for this one.  The green tea version had it listed in the description, which I didn't read that closely.  Its package had a sticker over the ingredients, so I didn't notice it before I drank it.  Beware before you buy.  If you are looking for a healthy drink, this isn't it.\",\n",
       " 'Yes, you are right.  This tea is expensive.  It is also quite marvelous.<br /><br />Right off the bat, I was impressed with the packaging of this tea.  The tea comes packed in the correct kind of tin, with both outer and inner tightly fitting lids.  When one pops out the inner lid, one is instantly rewarded with a waft of the wonderful scent of jasmine.  Ah..... Heaven.  Or, if not Heaven, at least a tropical garden at twilight.<br /><br />Now what\\'s this? you might ask.  This doesn\\'t smell like the jasmine tea from the local Chinese takeout place.  Yep.  It sure doesn\\'t.  That\\'s because this is The Real Deal.  This tea is made up of whole baby tea leaves (\"white tea\") and whole jasmine flowers.  No raggedy bits and pieces of leaves and twigs were to be found anywhere.  No jasmine \"flavoring.\"  No bitter aftertaste.  Mmmmmmmmmmmm.....<br /><br />I carefully prepared the tea according to directions - one tablespoon of tea leaves per 8 oz. of water heated to 185 degrees.  The directions said to steep the tea from four to five minutes, which seemed excessive to me, as I didn\\'t want bitter tea.  But in a real test, one must follow the directions, so I let the tea infuser sit in the water for a full five minutes.  And I was rewarded.  This is an utterly delightful tea, completely lacking the bitterness that can be associated with green teas.  This tea is wonderful \"as is\" - no sweetener or milk should be added, in my opinion.<br /><br />The directions also stated that one tablespoon can be steeped \"multiple times.\" Well, how many times is \"multiple?\"  Good question.  The first cup steeped was delightfully aromatic.  The second cup less so, but still good.  The third cup was rather pedestrian, the fourth cup just bland.  Not bitter, not awful, just bland.  I didn\\'t try a fifth round of steeping.  This is a tea best suited for someone who is going to want more than one cup of tea within a fairly short time span - if that is you, you will find there is a lot of bang for the buck with this product.<br /><br />All in all, I find this tea to be just wonderful.',\n",

This Gunpowder is not tightly rolled, the leaves are not vibrant and the taste is just not what it should be. I got the subscription for the 1lb bags, but canceled it after I received this due to it being B grade tea.<br /><br />Gunpowder should be green (not brownish green), tightly rolled and have a rich heavy taste after 2 minutes of steep at about 170 degrees.',\n",

       " '\"Rich Tea\" are the quintessential English tea-time biscuit, to be served mid-afternoon with a fine cup of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3WS7K\">English Tea</a> (taken with milk, not lemon). And McVitie make the finest \"Rich Tea\", having exactly the correct texture and firmness and delicate flavour which these biscuits should have. \"Rich Tea\" are also the ultimate dunking biscuits, for which purposes they must, of course, be entirely whole and not cracked even in the slightest, otherwise they will instantly fall in half and disappear to the bottom of the cup. Even whole, these biscuits present the maximum challenge to the dunker -- leave the biscuit in the tea just a fraction of a second too long and, again, you\\'ll wonder where your biscuit went (and why you have blotting paper at the bottom of your cup).  [American readers please note that dunking is, of course, entirely frowned upon in English high society, as an activity undertaken only by the peasant classes. It is thus to be indulged in only when entirely alone and in the privacy of one\\'s own home, when there is no danger of being observed by the servants.]<br /><br />Should your biscuits arrive broken, as may, unfortunately, be all too likely (as these are a fragile biscuit and McVitie\\'s packaging consists of no more than a paper wrapper) do not despair; all is not lost. Simply tip a quantity of the broken biscuits into a bowl and pour hot milk over them. The result may look like soggy blotting paper, but the eating experience is exquisite!',\n",
       " \"I have been drinking tea for some decades, and keeping notes to remind myself of favorites.<br /><br />Green teas usually benefit from steeping at cooler temperatures, and this Boston Tea Dragon Well is no exception. I suggest using water of 185 degrees or cooler.<br /><br />My experience with this Dragonwell was disappointing. The tea was flat and anemic. Not only was there no complexity or freshness to the aroma, the leaves simple had little fragrance at all.<br /><br />The bag I received had no packing or expiration dates. But, the lack of aroma was the first clue that the tea was long past its peak. Older tea does not become rancid, but taste and aroma diminish as packaged tea ages. For best results, search for teas with a packing date of less than six or eight months previous.<br /><br />Trying to obtain more flavor from the tea, I tried longer brewing times and even higher temperatures. More tannins were released, giving some bitterness, but flavor did not improve.<br /><br />Bottom line: I personally will be cautious of buying any Boston Tea product without learning packaging/expiration dates. Trying this Dragonwell is an inexpensive gamble, and perhaps you will receive fresher inventory than I did. However, the package I received truly deserves a rating of two stars.<br /><br />Options: I enjoy Peet's Lung Ching Dragonwell, which comes in a steel canister. And, sometimes Asian markets can yield unusual pleasures. I recently picked up Tian Hu Shan Dragon Well for just a few dollars. It was reasonably good, and certainly more flavorful than this Boston Tea product when I did a taste comparison. Good luck in your tea tastings.\",\n",

Cold brewing just means that you place the tea bags in the fridge in water and let it set, usually at least 3 hours. It\\'s that simple! It maintains the full subtle flavor of the tea much better and is almost impossible to turn bitter or mess it up unless you use too many tea bags. This only works if you plan to have iced tea of course. I use 4 \"Awake\" tea bags in 2 quarts of water and let it set overnight. I don\\'t remove the tea bags until I have drank all the tea.

One packet, at 17 g, is getting a bit close to typical desert levels (I checked some sorbet in my frig, 23 g).<br /><br />That aside, I prefer this to the ginger tea I've been getting at a local Korean market, a kind of marmalade or jelly with ginger slices in a jar.  Not only does this product have a stronger, hotter ginger flavor, but it can be used in place of granulated sugar.\",\n",
       " 'I have heard this described as a \"starter\" green tea. One of its general selling points is that it has a sweet, floral flavor that sits on top of and \"does away with\" some of the things about green tea that drive some first time users away: the grassy flavor and bitter aftertaste. I like it, but I am not really crazy about it.<br /><br />To me, this is a tea to have in moderate amounts. Though it makes a nice alternative to try some new flavor, it is not actually a blend I favor keeping too much around (the pound or so you get in the \"Amazon six-pack\" will probably last me for a couple of years and I drink 8-12 cups of tea a day if not more). I would recommend making it sort of weak because if you approach any real level of tea strength the jasmine flavor will become the opposite of its intention: cloying and bitter. It mixes well with Twining\\'s Gunpowder Green (half and half, some allowances for the differences in textures) if you are interested in a slightly more appropriate \"starter\" blend that allows the natural taste of green to shine but still clips off the more leafy flavor on the back of the tongue.<br /><br />The best time to drink this, it seems to me, is a relaxed moderate day where you can get something of a natural breeze to go with the absolute best bit of this blend: its aroma.',\n",
       " \"A Ming Dynasty (AD 1368 - 1644) creation believed to lower cholesterol and promote longevity, jasmine tea consists of Chinese green tea leaves - usually green teas from Fujian province, which is also home to the semi-fermented Oolong and smoky Lapsang Souchong - scented with jasmine flowers. Traditionally, the flowers are harvested during the day and stored in a cool place until nightfall, when they develop their full fragrance. They are then layered over the tea leaves, which have previously been steamed or heated to prevent their oxidation. The tea's quality is determined both by the quality of the green tea used as its base and by the effectiveness of the scenting process. Brewed, it has a delicate, silvery color and a rich fragrance reminiscent of a flower garden in bloom.\",\n",

I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several \"natural\" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using \"natural\" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty.

The instructions state to use two bags for every 8 oz. of iced tea. At Starbucks they do not follow this. To cut costs they use one tea bag for every 8 oz. of water then they double the steeping time indicated on the box. I make well over a gallon of tea out of each box that I buy. And yes...it tastes exactly like the Starbucks ones. If you like it sweet DONT add honey or powdered sugar because it will have a totally different taste then Starbucks...instead just buy a bottle of the Starbucks classic syrup available at all Starbucks.

I had only tried Starbucks Matcha (PLEASE BE ADVISED - it is very tasty, but probably because the number one ingredient on the label is sugar). Also, a pound of Starbucks Matcha (as sold on a popular auction site) costs about the same as a pound of Culinary Teas bulk Matcha)...so you are getting far less of the expensive and healthful green tea powder and more sugar (the Starbucks product is somehow micronized so it does mix into solution much easier than a less processed pure tea powder). The teaspoon on the right is Teavana (at $16 for 30 grams - thats 2 Tbsp) they said it was the highest \"tea ceremony\" quality matcha. The teaspoon on the left is the bulk (1 lb, silver bag) CT product. Photo taken without a flash and not retouched so actual colors show. CT matcha  is slightly less brilliant green. I mixed exact quantities (1/2 tsp) of matcha in 8 oz of liquid with exact quantities of sweetener (a blend of xylitol and stevia that I am experimenting with). The CT matcha tastes slightly less \"green\" and slightly more bitter than the Teavana, but I did the math ( a pound of CT would cost $240 at the Teavana $16 per 30 g cost) - so I am very happy with my CT purchase. Will use the smaller container for my \"working\" supply, freeze the rest and use as needed. Am finding Matcha to be a great substitute for my \"too much coffee\" habit and prefer the less instantaneous (but prolonged) energy boost it gives - not too mention alkalizing instead of acidifying, ECGC, and possible metabolism boosting effect.<br />PS Most Starbucks barristas do not know the Matcha powder contains sugar, so they will tell you the are not adding any.

There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a \"premium\" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.

       " '****<br /><br />This Goji Berry Green Tea from Yogi Tea is a daily energy tonic. It\\'s an all natural tea made from organic green tea leaf, natural and organic flavors, organic green matcha tea leaf, and goji berries (lyceum barbarum). The taste is mild, only very slightly berry-like, tasting mostly of green tea, with a very pleasant aroma; in fact, it\\'s so mild, that I would definitely use two tea bags and brew it for the full six minutes. It does not get bitter. Unless you enjoy very mild tea, you should plan on getting fewer cups of tea from the box. For this reason I gave this tea only four stars.<br /><br />I am impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Goji Berry Green Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it\\'s not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea\\'s benefits: \"Green Tea Goji Berry is an uplifting daily tonic that promotes energy and revitalization with a fragrant blend of Organic Green Tea, Organic Japanese Green Matcha Tea and Goji Berry. For centuries, the peoples of the Far East have treasured Green Tea as a delicious and energizing tonic. A recent study in the American Journal of Physiology-Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology (2005) suggests that long-term consumption of Green Tea might provide increased endurance while exercising. Green Tea is also celebrated for its antioxidant properties, which may help promote longevity. This formula also contains Organic Japanese Green Matcha Tea, a powdered form of green tea that provides a burst of energy and delicate flavor. The bright red Goji Berry has been consumed for centuries in the East, and is considered one of the most healing fruits in Traditional Chinese Medicine. This treasured fruit helps convert food into energy, protect the liver from damaging toxins and provides a boost to both the immune and circulation systems. Find yourself on the path to a revitalized life with the invigorating qualities of Green Tea Goji Berry.\"<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Goji Berry Green Tea contains approximately 52 mg of caffeine per tea bag, which is a bit over half of what is normally found in an 8 oz cup of coffee. It\\'s a pretty strong green tea, with a good portion of the energizing effect coming from caffeine.<br /><br />I really like this tea, and it is very health-promoting. Recommended.<br /><br />****',\n",
       " \"First off I'd like to say, I just tried this tea for the first time, and I loved it. The tea has a subtle flavor, that is hard to describe. It has a pleasant taste that is not to overwhelming, but refreshing. It gives you a boost after drinking it, and leaves you feeling more alert and peaceful. The goji berries have a slightly sweet and bitter flavor, and taste like they were just picked. I have always been impressed with yogi teas. Not only do they  taste good, but they are all very healthy and promote healing. I would also like to add, that the goji berry is one of the most healing fruits in traditional chinese medicine. After I drink up my boxes of tea, I will definitely order more. This tea is 100% percent organic, made from a proprietary blend of green tea, green matcha tea leaf, and goji berries.\",\n",
       " \"Twinings is known for delivering consistency and value. This tea is no exception.<br /><br />Most of the Twinings Darjeeling blend is black, but you can spot some green particles. The Twinings loose tea has no uncut leaves. The blend uses smaller, less-expensive particles which infuse more quickly than whole leaves. The Twinings tea has enough tannins to tolerate milk or a sweetener. It has some harshness when infusing is done at too high a temperature or for too long.<br /><br />I suggest steeping not more than 2 to 2.5 minutes to control bitterness. You may even want to check every 15 seconds starting at two minutes, since Darjeeling can quickly 'bolt' to a point of unpleasant sharpness. To avoid particulate matter in your drink, use a strainer or infuser with a fine mesh. (Amazon sells Tovolo, Teeli, and Frieling/Swissgold filters with very small openings in their screens.)<br /><br />To gain the best flavor, I recommend brewing at a temperature of 185F or cooler. (A clean candy or meat thermometer can quickly guide your efforts.) If you have been brewing with water that is near boiling, you will be shocked by the huge transformation from using water that cools a couple minutes after reaching the boiling point.<br /><br />I have enjoyed quality Darjeeling, the 'champagne of teas,' for over three decades while keeping notes to track favorites. And, how do I rate Twinings? A bargain. And, if your enjoy Twinings, I suggest trying some other Darjeeling teas, perhaps estate grown. The better Darjeeling teas come from the higher elevations where the cooler mountain environment slows leaf growth and develops a fine flavor. Where should you search? Check reviews at Amazon and other sellers. Among the packaged brands, I love Peets - normally known for their coffees.<br /><br />This Twinings tea is a bargain and a fine introduction to the wide range of Darjeeling teas.\",\n",
       " \"Always liked the taste of darjeeling tea. True to the form, the really good stuff is quite expensive, but then there is Twinnings - to me it's the best of affordable teas.<br /><br />Bonus for sloppy people: it's hard to oversteep.

The trick to avoiding aftertaste with stevia powder is not to try to make the food too sweet.  1/16 of a teaspoon is enough for a 12 ounce cup of tea - sweet but not too sweet and no aftertaste.  Use 1/8 of a teaspoon in 12 oz. of tean and the tea will taste as sweet as soda pop and the aftertaste will still be around an hour later.<br /><br />I have been using this product as a sugar substitute for about a month (replacing aspartame - Equal) and recommend it without reservation.',\n",

       " \"I have been a fan of Lipton's tea for more than 40 years.  As other teas have gained in popularity, I have managed to stay with my favorite.  I also admit that I prefer the unsweetened without lemon flavor, but presweetened with lemon is my second favorite choice.  I also prefer the fully caffeinated ice tea mix.  There are decaffeinated versions available for those who are unable to handle caffeine.<br /><br />Thomas Lipton, a native of Glasgow, entered the tea business in 1890, with the goal of making tea affordable.  In 1893 he established the Thomas J. Lipton Co. in New Jersey.  In 1915 Lipton was incorporated with Thomas Lipton as its first president.<br /><br />While it is uncertain as to when ice tea was first invented, it was offered at the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904, and became an instant hit.  When I was a child growing up in Kansas City, there was nothing like a cold glass of Lipton Ice Tea after being outside in the hot Missouri summer.  Green tea may offer qualities that black tea does not, brewed tea may offer a truer flavor, but I still like good old instant Lipton Ice Tea.  I must go now as I am getting thirsty for a glass of Lipton Ice Tea.\",\n",

We have tried double brewing at least 5 other varieties of tea, but they don't hold up- they come out flavorless and watery.<br /><br />The other nice thing about this Yunnan variety tea, is that it tastes great black (husband's preference) or with milk and honey (my preference).<br /><br />I highly recommend this tea.

Only about 1.5 tsp. is enough for a full, big 8 oz. cup to produce a marvelous tea, and steep only 2.5 minutes, precisely, not 3 or more minutes... that will produce a tannic tea that is loses the sweetness that is inherent in the tea brewed a short span.

There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a \"premium\" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don\\'t expect anything outstanding.',\n",

They are tiny little leaves allowed to dry and curl up, so expect to see almost mini-peppercorn-like granules. If you're not familiar with leaf teas, the boiling/steeping time is higher, and the outcome is very strong, so if your normal cup of tea involves lukewarm water and Celestial Seasoning, I'd let this be. Note that you should use less, but not steep it a shorter time. The full taste only develops after the leaves open up.<br /><br />I'm from the Indian subcontinent, and once I got this, I introduced it to other folks from around there, and they've all been sold on the taste, aroma, and body. I personally feel that's a pretty good endorsement from that bunch.<br /><br />Also, this is a huge pile of tea, enough to fill a 5lb bag of sugar (though of course much lighter in weight).

It\\'s probably more the case that you are going to either love or hate this tea after the first couple of cups (give yourself a couple of cups\\' worth before passing judgement, so that you don\\'t confuse surprise with dislike). You have as much chance of liking or disliking this tea as you do any other. I personally think Earl Grey has a \"funkier\" smell and taste to it than Lapsang, though that doesn\\'t stop me from drinking it.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and start with fresh water in a clean kettle, and a fresh tea-bag in a cup or mug. Even with a mug, my experience has been that the brew time suggested is a little long. Go with 4 rather than 5, and that might help if you are nervous that the tea is going to be especially bitter. Really, this tea, if properly made, is not bitter at all. In fact, I never add sugar or sweeteners to any tea, and Lapsang tastes slightly sweet to me on its own.<br /><br />For a supermarket tea, this is a bargain. I got a 20-count in the grocery store on a 2 for 5-buck sale, and it\\'s hard to beat roughly 12 cents for a pour, for this quality. To give you a comparison, I\\'m currently curing a Yixing teapot with a premium green tea that ran 40-some dollars for the quarter-pound.

Plus, you get an additional discount if you sign up for regular shipping every month or three months or six months, which makes sense if you are a regular tea drinker like me.

Rooibos is best brewed at 190F, allowing for steeping from 3 to 5 minutes tops. It has zero caffeine and reportedly has 50 times the antioxidants of green tea.

Stronger than most other teas, the blend is made to match the traditionally heavy English breakfast, which to this day often includes pork, sausages and eggs, and for this reason English Breakfast tea also maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk.

After some research, I found out that there are several \"natural\" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using \"natural\" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.

You put what look like little BBs of green tea into your cup or teapot, add the water, and you can see the tea practically explode into nearly full size leaves of tea (hence the name).<br /><br />Davidson's tea disappoints. The tea leaves really don't expand much which tells me they weren't really rolled the way gunpowder green tea is supposed to be. This tea also lacks flavor (at least compared to the other gunpowder green teas I've tried). I used the same amount to brew the same cup of tea I've been enjoying with Twinnigs and frankly the Davidson's version tasted more like hot water than green tea. This may be because the leaves aren't as compacted as a proper gunpowder green tea so the same tablespoon of tea now has less actual mass of tea leaves, it could be because this tea has a lower quality tea leaf in it, heck it could be because this is an old batch of tea for all I know.<br /><br />The point of this review is to say that this tea was a complete waste of money. I am sorry to say I paid for an entire pound of it. I will try it once or twice more, but if the results remain the same I will likely have to throw out the rest of the bag and that would just make me sad because it would mean that I've wasted both money and tea.<br /><br />I have added a photo of the actual tea I received (compare it to that in the original product photos and you'll see a huge difference).

I did not expect this.  As for the taste, it\\'s okay; not our favorite gunpowder green, but for the price, the taste was acceptable.

I don't like sweeteners in my tea, and I was afraid that teas that were meant to taste like desserts would have to taste as if they were sweetened.  Thankfully I was wrong!  I've now tried several of Adagio's dessert teas and they are wonderful- chocolate is one of the best.  The flavor of this tea is strong, and it tastes unmistakably of chocolate.  But thankfully, somehow, it does not taste as thought it is has been sweetened with sugar.  It's amazing- I have no idea how Adagio manages it, but the taste is smooth, rich, creamy chocolate, just not sugary.  This works beautifully as an after-dinner tea, and it fulfills my need for dessert after dinner (well, most of the time).  I think it is excellent with a splash of milk.

I've been testing them out on various teas - loose chamomile, green tea, I even took some Tazo out of the tea bags and tried it in the Solofill - all tests passed with flying colors.  There isn't much documentation out there for using a Keurig as a tea brewer from loose, but I am extremely pleased withe the results so far - it will press tea from too weak to overly strong depending on grind and amount.  I ground some coffee and tried it in the solo - it was great.  The pressed coffee using Solofill and Keurig tastes superior to the drip-brewed coffee in our Melitta or Krups coffee maker.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, \"a more aromatic version of the Earl\\'s traditional black tea scented with the essence of bergamot\"; therein lies the problem---a little too perfumy and scented for me. On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as \"floral, lavender, fragrant, spicy, lemon\". Tazo describes the aroma as \"citrus, lavender, light smoke\".  You may like it; apparently the other reviewers so far do, but it is not for me at all.<br /><br />Also, be careful of letting this tea brew too long accidently. Even a few minutes too long results in a bitter, bitter tea, reminiscent of orange pekoe with a strong perfume added. What a letdown! Even properly brewed, though, this tea cannot, in my opinion, warrant more than three stars.<br /><br />The ingredients in Earl Grey are just black teas and bergamot essence. Note that Earl Grey does contain caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, \"a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the Himalayas.\" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Chai as \"cinnamon, creamy, sweet spice\" and \"medium-bodied yet full-flavored, with the spicy kick of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and black pepper.

       " 'In many languages around the world, \"chai\" simply means \"tea.\" In India, however, the word denotes a specialty that to tea lovers even in the West is fast becoming what cappuccino already is to coffee lovers: spiced milk tea.<br /><br />Chai comes in a variety of recipes that differ from region to region, although traditionally it consists of a blend of black tea, rich milk, various spices and a sweetner. The spices most commonly used are cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and pepper; Tazo\\'s very peppery Chai adds rooibos, vanilla, star anise and chicory to the traditional recipe.<br /><br />You should always have this tea with real sugar, even if you have all your regular tea without any kind of sweetener, because only sugar will bring out the full flavor of the spices. And if you like your store-bought Chai, maybe you\\'ll one day try brewing chai from fresh black tea and spices, too! Namaste ...',\n",

       " \"I love this tea. I tried it initially at P.F changs restaurant and ordered it immediately after I found out what brand and flavor it was. It truly needs no sugar added just the wedge of a lemon. Trust me I'm a 24 year old who loves soda and sugar and I'm telling you this tea is perfect with just a wedge of lemon. Not only is it delicious but I've found that I lost a couple pounds because I'm drinking much less soda.<br /><br />Since the product description is lacking here is mine:::<br />Be aware that this tea is lose leaf and doesn't come in tea bags. After doing some research on the web I found that the best way to brew the tea is as follows. Each plastic bag inside the box has 3/4 ounce of tea. This should make 3/4 gallon or 96 ounces. So all you need to do is bring to a boil half the amount or 48 ounces in a pot. Then let it sit off the burner for 2 minutes. Then add the pouch of loose leaf tea [3/4 ounce in total] and let it steep or brew for 7 minutes.... 10 minutes is too long and 5 minutes is too short. So set a timer it's important.<br />After 7 minutes strain the water through a strainer with a paper towel layed in it. *** Make sure the bowl is beneath the strainer ***. Then put the strained liquid into a pitcher and add the remaining 48 ounces of tap water. Refridgerate and in an hour so should be good to go.<br /><br />In each of these boxes there are 24 3/4 ounces packages which will make a total of 18 gallons of iced tea.\",\n",
       " 'Yogi, \\'Perfect Energy Vanilla Spice Tea,\\' is an ambitious grouping of Green Tea, and Black Assam Tea, with several herbs and spices making recent news, for promoting health benefits.  The added bonus resides in one of the Yogi Principles: \"We work with what nature already offers rather than trying to concoct it.  We don\\'t have laboratories.  We have kitchens.\"  That said, it\\'s no wonder the, all natural Yogi brand, has a dedicated following.<br /><br />I personally really like this blend.  The fragrance is enticing, and there is just enough spice to mask some of the underlying earthiness detected, likely from the herbs.  It IS a very mild tea. I\\'ve resorted to two bags per cup for full flavor, which is why I took off one star for this review.  Once brewed, I add a little Rosemary and Lavender honey, and it\\'s yummy.  With two tea bags providing approximately 160 mg of caffeine, I would normally expect to feel jittery.  The fact is, I\\'m quite the opposite. I don\\'t feel particularly more energized, but I do feel somewhat more focused to task.<br /><br />Here\\'s a list of ingredients: Green Tea, Black Assam Tea, Cinnamon Bark, Rooibos Leaf, Honeybush, Ginger Root, Licorice Root, Stevia Leaf, GotuKola Leaf, Ashwagandha Root, Shatavari Root, Shankpushpi, and lastly 15 mg of L-Theanine.<br /><br />Interestingly, L-Theanine Suntheanine, has had several clinical trials with some evidence that it assists in managing stress, anxiety and PMS, while enhancing the immune system.  The problem is, that the recommended dose is 50 to 200 mg/day.  With only 15 mg per tea bag, you\\'d have to drink four cups for the minimum therapeutic effect.  Perhaps when coupled with Shatavari, and Shankpushpi, which both provide some nervous system support, too, less is required to offset the caffeine jitters. Surprisingly, it does seem to work.<br /><br />I\\'ve noticed a little more diuretic effect than with simple teas. Perhaps this is a result of the Shatavari Root, which is \\'Indian Asparagus,\\' but I\\'m not sure.  You will want to avoid this tea, if you are allergic to asparagus, or any of the other ingredients.  And, as with many other herbal tea blends, it is not to be used by pregnant, or breastfeeding women, infants, or children. It\\'s a good idea to familiarize yourself with ALL the listed ingredients.  Yes, there are benefits, but also potential side effects. For example, Ashwagandha Root is not recommended for those with thyroid disorders, or liver ailments, without consulting your physician. Enjoy, the bounty of nature, but always be informed.<br /><br />Will I purchase in the future?  Yes, I think I will.',\n",

One reviewer said the tea was \"tasteless\" and another cited poor packaging affecting the freshness.<br /><br />I\\'m glad I took the chance because I disagree on both counts.  The taste is excellent which is, of course, the most important factor.  I love strong, aromatic, flavorful tea and this does not disappoint.

Of course it is best to make sure you press out all of the air before resealing the top...I usually tap it on the counter to settle the contents then bend the top over on itself while leaning over on it, then seal it.

I will no longer be needing to purchase this supplement. This also is a tea that has very little caffeine and it did not make me nervous like the average teas do.<br />I do recommend this tea to everyone especially if you have any of these problems, but for me I enjoyed a very restful day without any jitters.<br /><br />As for the cost, this morning I cut off 2 grams of the tea and I am just finishing it, you can brew this tea many many times as you can see in the video, this makes it, for me, a very inexpensive tea.

       " '*****<br />This Fasting Tea from Yogi Tea for Weight Loss Support is \"designed to promote healthy functioning of the stomach and intestines, and to help you feel more energetic while you lose weight.\" Fasting Tea is based on an Ayurvedic formula---Ayurveda is an Indian form of health care now also becoming popular in the United States.<br /><br />It\\'s suggested that you drink Fasting Tea 15 minutes before eating. I have done this, and it does really seem to help, although I\\'m not quite sure if the effect is physiological or psychological. Oh, well, I don\\'t care, since it helps me to be in control of my eating. It has a sweet and pleasing taste, and is quite enjoyable to sip on while others are filling up on bread, appetizers, and high-calorie drinks and alcohol.<br /><br />I am impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Fasting Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it\\'s not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea\\'s benefits: \"Fasting is made with organic Red Clover and Garcinia Fruit designed to help support a healthy weight loss program, as it aids digestive functions, supports the metabolism and encourages internal cleansing. The tea includes hydroxy-citric acid that is found in the Garcinia Fruit, native to Southeast Asia. This naturally occurring substance has been shown to simultaneously suppress the appetite, help reduce fats and cholesterol in the liver and disrupt the process by which the body stores excess calories as fat. We have also included the warming herbs Fennel Seed, Cinnamon Bark and Black Pepper to help promote circulation, as well as Red Clover, which works as a tonic and a blood purifier. The recipe is complimented with Alfalfa Leaf, Indian Bacopa Leaf (Gotu Kola), and English Hawthorn Berry, all of which can aid the body in the elimination of wastes that are known to slow the metabolism. Finally, we\\'ve included Burdock, Dandelion and Yellow Dock Roots, all used by European herbalists for centuries to support the liver in eliminating toxins.\" Other ingredients in this tea are Licorice Root, Alfalfa Leaf, Cardamom Seed, Ginger Root, Clove Bud, Barley Malt, Date Powder, Natural Plum Flavor, and Natural Passion Fruit Flavor. Almost every ingredient in this tea is also organic.<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Fasting Tea contains no caffeine whatsoever. It steeps for 5-10 minutes, a nice long time, but I find that I only need one tea bag instead of two for a wonderful flavor.<br /><br />I really like this tea, and it is very health-promoting.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br />*****',\n",

This Mate Chocolatte tea solves that problem with its blend of yummy spices (nutmeg, cinnamon and clove) and sweetening agents (cocoa and Stevia).  Stevia is one powerful sweetener, so there's no need to sweeten this tea at ALL!  All ingredients are fully organic, so you're doing your body good by drinking it.<br /><br />Yerba Mate is great for energy, also (one of the reasons I've been a fan for so long!) since it is naturally caffeinated, plus it helps to rid your body of accumulated toxins while providing you with vitamins, minerals, amino acids and antioxidants.

And so, it is no wander that I am continuously on a quest for a better tasting leaf.<br /><br />As of lately, my choice has been the Black Pearl. Its fairly recent appearance on supermaket shelves has saved me from frequent trips to a not-so-local tea boutique. The Black Prearl is en excellent choice for those who, like myself, enjoy the brew without the addition of taste masking ingredients, such as lemon, sugar, or milk.<br /><br />The leaves are large (tea dust in the bag is an indicatour of inferiour quality). They brew a liquid that is golden in color (make sure your tea cup is white to enable you to admire it), strong but sweet in taste (unlike most Lipton brands that brew too dark and bitter for my liking), and an aroma that is true to the taste (be patient and allow it to develop; too short a brew=no aroma; too long=bitter taste).<br /><br />The Black Pearl presentation, a fabric piramid, is an added bonus, especially if you are brewing directly in a cup, or a transparent tea pot. My suggestion is to always use a tea pot as it lengthens the experience and allows for a better water to leaf ratio manipulation (quick tip regarding water: OVERboiling removes oxygen and prevents the maximization of flavour!).<br /><br />Sip and enjoy!<br /><br />PS: The price I have paid for this product on Amazon thru Subscribe and Save is HALF of what the supermarket charges!

It is not too tanic and the infusion provided by the pyramid style bags is much better than the traditional tea bag.

       " 'I learned to love English \"black\" teas drinking Tetley during a study abroad trip in London. The taste is unlike anything found in coffee shops or grocery store shelves in the States. Tetley, like Typhoo, has an impressively strong English Breakfast taste--so strong that I found myself using 5-6 English breakfast teabags after my return to the US simply *trying* (and failing) to duplicate the flavor. After many unsuccessful attempts, I was disappointed to find that Tetley was not available at Costco World Market or any other import stores in my area. Reluctant to ask my British friends to mail me some, I decided to try the only brand that was available, which was Typhoo. This stuff, in my opinion, is very similar to but ever so slightly better than Tetley.<br /><br />For those who haven\\'t tried this \"kind\" of tea before, I\\'ll describe it in a word as being very heavy. One teabag can powerfully flavor a large American mug of water--far more, thankfully, than the 8-ounce maxim most instant beverage companies push. Its taste, like I\\'ve said, is similar to a very strong English Breakfast tea, but that taste is so strong that I personally would hesitate to call it by that name. It\\'s an altogether different kind of tea in my opinion, labeled on the bag simply as \"black tea,\" reminiscent only (in my experience) of Tetley and PG-Tips. With just water, it produces a rich, slightly bitter drink with a somewhat fruity aftertaste. Adding cold milk to the already-steeped drink can smooth the tart taste a bit (as well as cool the drink if you\\'re not one for piping hotness). Adding sugar to either the dark or \"white\" versions can change the flavor more than you\\'d expect, too. The first cup of Tetley I ever drank had *a lot* of milk and sugar in it, and the taste wasn\\'t ruined at all: it tasted very much like a sweet and mild desert drink, something like cocoa (only with a completely different flavor). The same, I\\'ve found, is true of Typhoo. I\\'ve not tried it with honey, lemon, or any other additions.<br /><br />The teabags diffuse their flavor FAST. If you\\'re one to microwave your water (blasphemous in all parts of the world except America, and with good reason, you might know, if you\\'ve ever tried tea made with stovetop- or kettle-boiled water), you can have a cup ready in about two minutes. Electric kettles are available too that are designed specifically for boiling water and can accomplish the task faster and better than a microwave. (These products, incidentally, are great for anyone who drinks lots of hot beverages of any kind: though the devices\\' directions will tell you to only use them to heat water, I regularly boil milk and other non-viscous liquids in mine without problems.) To help with the steeping process, put the teabag in an empty mug or cup and pour the hot water over the bag. The water will immediately begin turning a dark amber color. After a few seconds, if the water is stirred, the diffusion process will speed up, and before you know it, poof! You have a very dark bronze, almost black, cup of tea with the strongest flavor you could hope for. Great for the office or people on the go.<br /><br />Sadly, to me at least, this tea tastes horrible when cold. If you have a tendency to let your hot drinks sit undrank until they are no longer hot drinks (oh, the tragedy!), you may be disappointed in the consequences of inattention to this cuppa. The actual flavor doesn\\'t change much, if at all, but the strong punch this beverage packs is far better suited for a hot drink than a cold one, a problem this tea\\'s weaker English Breakfast competitors don\\'t face. Though this is an opinion, my advice is to not allow this (or any other tea) to become cold, if only for the fact that drinking hot tea which, through apathy, preoccupation, or forgetfulness, has been forced to watch teary-eyed as its hotness slips away, is the most cruel sort of ridiculous. Be kind to your tea and drink it fast, lest it begin to believe it is not tea at all, but perhaps some mutated spawn of the Kool-Aid Man.<br /><br />Ergo, this product makes for an excellent meal tea or desert drink, though not necessarily for breakfast on account of its heady flavor. Oh, and this is a good tea for English biscuits, too, though I would only drink it with the plain ones. (Chocolate doesn\\'t get on well with this stuff.)',\n",
       " 'I am new to matcha drinking, so was somewhat concerned re: customer comments Culinary Teas matcha being \"brown\" (i.e. a not the correct bright green color). I had only tried Starbucks Matcha (PLEASE BE ADVISED - it is very tasty, but probably because the number one ingredient on the label is sugar). Also, a pound of Starbucks Matcha (as sold on a popular auction site) costs about the same as a pound of Culinary Teas bulk Matcha)...so you are getting far less of the expensive and healthful green tea powder and more sugar (the Starbucks product is somehow micronized so it does mix into solution much easier than a less processed pure tea powder). The teaspoon on the right is Teavana (at $16 for 30 grams - thats 2 Tbsp) they said it was the highest \"tea ceremony\" quality matcha. The teaspoon on the left is the bulk (1 lb, silver bag) CT product. Photo taken without a flash and not retouched so actual colors show. CT matcha  is slightly less brilliant green. I mixed exact quantities (1/2 tsp) of matcha in 8 oz of liquid with exact quantities of sweetener (a blend of xylitol and stevia that I am experimenting with). The CT matcha tastes slightly less \"green\" and slightly more bitter than the Teavana, but I did the math ( a pound of CT would cost $240 at the Teavana $16 per 30 g cost) - so I am very happy with my CT purchase. Will use the smaller container for my \"working\" supply, freeze the rest and use as needed. Am finding Matcha to be a great substitute for my \"too much coffee\" habit and prefer the less instantaneous (but prolonged) energy boost it gives - not too mention alkalizing instead of acidifying, ECGC, and possible metabolism boosting effect.<br />PS Most Starbucks barristas do not know the Matcha powder contains sugar, so they will tell you the are not adding any.

It has a really great taste.  I prefer to mix mine a little thicker than recommended.  It gives it that bite, that you enjoy so much.',\n",
       " 'A friend recommended this tea, saying that it basically knocked her out at bedtime. I have two small kids so that really isn\\'t a problem, but I liked the idea of a nice relaxing tea to enjoy during a little quiet time at night.<br /><br />This tea is wonderful. I brewed it up, enjoying the vapors, then drank it in a leisurely fashion (while watching \"Scrubs\", but that\\'s neither here nor there). It is very tasty. My cat wanted to eat the teabag in a big way, which was charming. Then she climbed up on my lap to smell my breath, which was just adorable.<br /><br />I didn\\'t doze off on the couch, which I half-expected based on what my friend had said, but I was verrrry melllooooooow. In a good way. A very good way.<br /><br />If you love tea but can\\'t drink the caffeinated stuff at night, try this. It is yum.',\n",
       " \"I was fairly skeptical when trying these, thinking they'd probably have little to no affect on me. I was way off. The tablets themselves are actually pretty nasty, like sucking on a vitamin, they take some time to dissolve so you've really got to be willing to put up with having these fairly unpleasant things in your mouth for at least 3-5 minutes. I recommend rolling them around all over the top of your tongue as you do, and trying not to swallow too often so you can really let your tongue absorb as much as it can. Another tip is that if you plan on trying this with liquids, do so after you've tried it with more solid foods as liquids will dissipate the effects much quicker.<br /><br />I gave it the old lemon test and I was shocked at just how sweet and delicious they were. Really, it made lemons taste like delicious lemon candy, not at all like those artificially flavored lemon drops. Natural applesauce was a bit much, but apples are already sweet so I sort of expected it. I also tried cheese, carrots, peanut butter, and while the peanut butter seemed a bit sweeter, the others didn't seem to show any affect at all.<br /><br />What impressed me the most, however, was tea. I poured myself a tall glass of unsweetened Lipton and it wasn't at all what I expected. Rather than making it taste sweet, it just removed the bitterness. Again, it's hard to articulate the sensation, but I can say that if you've ever wondered what tea tastes like without being overpowered by sweeteners or the natural bitterness found in most teas, try it with these tablets. The effect will wear off after a few minutes when you drink, but the taste you get is so uniquely pure. In all honesty, you haven't experienced tea until you've had a cup with one of these.<br /><br />I've read that wine is also good, so I may try that sometime in the future, along with other bitter fruits. I'm also curious how tomatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, and bell peppers will taste. Whatever I decide, I really feel these things have opened up a whole new world of flavor experiences, and I'm really looking forward to trying them all.<br /><br />I totally recommend these tabs just for the experience, but as an alternative to sugar, they're way too expensive at this point.<br /><br />Happy Tasting!\",\n",
       " 'I apologize to the makers of this drink for saying this, but it is just not good. At all. To be honest I think it tastes curiously like mouthwash. I can\\'t really get past that and enjoy it. It\\'s almost like mint tea that has waaaaay too much sugar in it or something. I am a HUGE fan of Synergy/GT\\'s Kombucha, but I thought I\\'d try this because it\\'s slightly cheaper. I have to say that the Synergy is well worth the extra $12 per 12 bottle case (I purchase the cases at Whole Foods for $35).<br /><br />Even if I could get past the minty mouthwash taste, I still have to question the health benefits of this brand of Kombucha given the ingredients list. It reads: Lightly carbonated water, sucrose, herbal tea blend, Kombucha cultures, lactobacilli, acerola juice concentrate. You don\\'t even get to kombucha until the fourth ingredient - and that comes after water and sugar?? One can drink seltzer water with sugar and \"herbal tea\" for much cheaper than $23/12 bottles. Seriously. Spend the extra few bucks and buy the Synergy, whose ingredients are as follows (this is for the \"Trilogy\" flavor): 95% GT\\'s organic raw kombucha, raspberry juice, lemon juice, fresh pressed ginger juice, and 100% pure love.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you want mint soda, then by all means, seize the day. If you want real, raw kombucha with health benefits AND a delicious taste, go for Synergy/GT\\'s Kombucha.',\n",
       " 'I am very surprised that I felt the way I did after trying one of these 5 hour energy drinks.  I did not think there was that much caffeine in each one but apparently there is because I had the jitter attacks bi-time which started about ten minutes after I finished the bottle.  I got the sick feeling and it did not go away for, well about 5 hours actually.  I was very close to putting my finger down my throat to try to throw it up thinking maybe that would make me feel better, although I\\'m a pretty big wimp so I didn\\'t do that.<br /><br />I am not overly sensitive to caffeine but while the 5-hour energy drink obviously works for some people, it did not work for me.

Serendipi Tea matcha culinary grade organic green tea from Japan, 4 oz. costs $17.43<br />(result: *****)<br /><br />2. Tea Zone matcha green tea powder, 8 oz. costs $16.99 (Amazon sells this as `Matcha Green Tea Powder By Malden Tea', but my black foil packaging label says it's made by Tea Zone)<br />(result: ****)<br /><br />3. Liquid Jade powdered matcha green tea 100% organic, 3 oz. Cost $18.46<br />(result: ***)<br /><br />Recipe:<br />I made 3 different cups of  `green tea latte' with the following method:<br />1 tsp tea powder,<br />mixed with filtered water into a smooth paste,<br />added to 1/3 cup hot soymilk + 1/3 cup boiling water + 1 tsp raw agave nectar,<br />frothed into a Latte-style tea with hand-pump device.<br />NOTE: I am a scientist.  Each cup was clearly labeled.  I tasted the teas side-by-side, taking 3 sips of each before proceeding to next sample.  I tasted in random order until all 3 cups were consumed.  Total time: 15 minutes.  I took lots of notes and drew graphs etc.<br /><br />Result:<br />Serendipi Tea (5+ stars)  won for sweet smooth flavor, amazing long lasting froth bubbles, and the fact it's organic!!  Cost: $4.30/oz but worth it.  Note on the packaging: For those reviewers complaining of the green tea powder leaking, I have to point out that it's hand packed, with a note explaining that you must pack it yourself in an airtight and light-blocking container.  Fine with me, since this is the best tea I've found, and the act of packing it myself is itself a ZEN moment in which I feel a connection to the individual soul who packed the brown bag by hand just for me.  You decide.<br /><br />Tea Zone (Malden Tea) (4+ stars) came in second for a very nice flavor, but the frothy bubbles popped sooner than the Serendipi Tea, making for a lower rating, and plus, it isn't organic.  But it gets extra points for its low cost:  $2.12/oz (can't beat it for a daily tea).<br /><br />Liquid Jade (3 stars) was an O.K. tea, ever-so-slightly more bitter than the other two I taste tested, and almost a chalky feeling (perhaps it was ground into larger particles than the other teas).  Yes it's organic, always a plus, but at a cost of $6.15/oz, no way will I buy this again when I can get TeaZone 4 stars for a third this cost, and Serendipi Tea 5 stars for significantly less money as well.  So long Liquid Jade (though I do love your container and I'll save it.)\",\n",
       " \"This organic matcha is great for everyday use!!!  I will definitely buy this matcha again and again!  I put matcha in smoothies or make tea by the quart with honey.  Ceremonial grade matcha is just too expensive to drink everyday by the quart or to load up smoothies with it.  This tea has a good, clean flavor that is flavorful enough without being overpowering.  I have found it to be delicious in smoothies made with a fresh peach or mango, coconut milk, honey, ice, and a teaspoon of this matcha powder dumped directly into the blender.  It is a great way to enjoy the delicate flavor of matcha and the health benefits never tasted so good!  You are getting many times over the anti-oxidant effects of green tea from a tea bag because you are actually ingesting the tea leaves when you enjoy matcha. When making matcha as a tea by itself, less is more.  I use 1 teaspoon to a whole teapot of steaming (not boiling) water (but I enjoy strong flavors), then I mix in honey after it cools a little.  After my morning cup of matcha, I store the remainder of the tea and honey in the fridge for iced matcha later that day.  The flavor can be strong by itself, especially if you don't enjoy strong flavors, so it might be a good idea to start with smaller amounts (1/8 teaspoon or less per cup water) and work your way up to suit your individual tastes.  Experiment and enjoy!\",\n",
       " \"I drink a lot of tea, and over the years I have done my own research. Inevitably, I discovered matcha, its abundant health benefits and its ease of preparation. Few who are not avid tea enthusiasts or those who don't drink high quality teas for their staggering health benefits, or gift of wellness, might not favor the taste of matcha. However, for the majority, matcha honestly does not taste bad, and if you disagree, just add some sweetness to it, like some agave, honey, lemon, stevia, or sugar. You could even mix up the condiments to create your own nirvana for your taste buds. Anyways, through all my searching for organic matcha, SerendipiTea offers the best price, and consistent availability I've seen yet!<br /><br />Thanks SerendipiTea :)\",\n",
       " \"Matcha is purported to have elevated antioxidant and cognitive benefits above standard green teas and was the reason for the purchase. The price is also correspondingly higher, and this brand was the least expensive with the most favorable reviews available on Amazon. This product was my introduction to matcha, and I was pleasantly surprised. It seems a more potent version of your typical, off-the-shelf green tea in just about every way. As a regular tea drinker, I can definitely see this becoming a frequent addition to the different teas I consume on a regular basis.<br /><br />The reason for the deduction of two stars was the packaging. The small box the tea is shipped in is small and relatively flimsy, but is sealed, which is not a big deal. However, as another reviewer testified, the plastic bag inside that actually contains the ground tea was not only partially unsealed, but I would estimate maybe a half tablespoon of powder escaped the bag's 'seal.' This is absolutely unacceptable. I don't care if you're shipping sand; any powder, let alone tea, let alone a finer grade of tea, needs to be completely sealed with an extraordinarily-high level of confidence that the bag is secure. I fail to believe this cannot be achieved within the boundaries of both successfully cost-effective and green packaging.<br /><br />As a broke university student trying to maximize dietary healthfulness on a restricted budget, I'd very much like to include matcha in my regular tea consumption, but I'm not sure I'll order again from this outfit. The unprofessional feel I experienced from this product was not insignificant.<br /><br />*****UPDATE - 10/13/11*****: I since reordered this product, and I was indeed surprised to find that any packaging concerns have been completely resolved. As in the pictures listed on the product page, the flimsy plastic the tea came in previously has been replaced by a thick, folded, brown bag placed inside a very solid tin - which I'm sure I'll reuse. The tea itself is fantastic and now it comes with killer packaging. Zero complaints about this product now; 5 big stars.\",\n",
       " \"A pleasure to read the glowing reviews here for this truly fine brand of tay. On an average day stretched to include morning, noon and night I can honestly say I must drink upwards of fourteen or fifteen scalding hot mugs of Barry's Gold Blend and not a bit of a bother on me neither during the entire length of the duration. Milk and a lump of sugar too, of course, black tea being something of a Paddy Kavanagh-like penance for the homegrown likes of me. Barry's tea is blended in the fabled city of Cork, me old stomping ground as a matter of fact, having being blended meself as a fat wee babby in nearly the exact same whereabouts some two score and seven years ago. Cork incidentally is also home to The Butter Museum, a revered if not indeed wholly sacred institution whose existence is quite properly the pride of Shandon. It hardly needs repeating I suppose that Barry's tea and butter are big news in Ireland although to be honest I myself never ever tire of repeating it. Lookit now and this is no lie but there I was just the other day watching John Huston's The MacKintosh Man from 1973 and sure weren't bits of it filmed in the west of Ireland and anyway along comes this bus at one point and here's what was written in giant green letters along the full length of it: BUTTER IS THE CREAM.

       " '***<br />Tazo\\'s Earl Grey Black Tea is very perfumy. I am used to drinking super-premium tea that have the real bergamot added, not the essence. So this tea tasted to me like regular black tea with a very, very strong bergamot-like flavor. I definitely did not care for it, although I love Earl Grey teas in general. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, \"a more aromatic version of the Earl\\'s traditional black tea scented with the essence of bergamot\"; therein lies the problem---a little too perfumy and scented for me. On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as \"floral, lavender, fragrant, spicy, lemon\". Tazo describes the aroma as \"citrus, lavender, light smoke\". You may like it; apparently the other reviewers so far do, but it is not for me at all.<br /><br />Also, be careful of letting this tea brew too long accidently. Even a few minutes too long results in a bitter, bitter tea, reminiscent of orange pekoe with a strong perfume added. What a letdown! Even properly brewed, though, this tea cannot, in my opinion, warrant more than three stars.<br /><br />The ingredients in Earl Grey are just black teas and bergamot essence. Note that Earl Grey does contain caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, \"The Reincarnation of Tea\". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some \"natural flavors\" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />Instead of Tazo\\'s Earl Grey, I would highly recommend Numi Earl Grey, which does not disappoint in any way and is comparable in cost. It too can be bought in bulk at the time of this review on Amazon.<br />***',\n",
       " 'I have been a tea drinker all my life (loose tea, not teabags), and this to me is the best Earl Grey I have ever tasted. I have bought this Taylors of Harrogate Earl Grey for years and despite occasionally trying a different brand, a different supplier, I am always coming back to this one.<br /><br />The best I can describe it is: It is balanced. Not too strong a bergamot taste, but not too much plain tea taste either. I would also describe it as elegant and delicate. I find Earl Greys that do not strike this fine balance to be either bland/flat or overpowering, in any case one-dimensional. To my taste buds, this one is perfect and has just the right amount of both key ingredients.<br /><br />Here are my tips to enjoy this tea to the fullest. I apologize if some of this seems self-evident, but I have encountered so many people who just did not know enough about tea, and then blamed it on the product that I want to make sure I am mentioning the key points:<br /><br />1. Storage<br />I keep my tea in the bag that it originally came in inside the box, and also clip it shut to preserve the aroma. When it comes to tea, it is critical to keep it away from light and to keep the storage container tightly shut. Also try to use up your tea in a reasonable amount of time or it will eventually go flat and old.<br /><br />2. Brewing<br />Use about 1 teaspoon per cup, and if you can, use filtered water (such as Brita-filtered, etc.). Then brew your tea with boiling water! And I mean boiling, not almost boiling.<br /><br />If you want to do it perfectly, give the tea leaves plenty of space - tea eggs are not the best choice to get the most flavorful taste. Ideally you will want to let the leaves float freely in the pot and then, after steeping, pour the tea through a strainer. But large tea filters also work. Examples are: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G72D70\">swissgoldÂ® TF 300 Tea Filter</a> or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KDW9MO\">Finum 100 Tea Filters - Large (Make your own Teabags)</a><br /><br />3. Steeping<br />Rule of thumb: Steeping tea for less than 3 minutes will have a slight wake-up effect, more than 3 minutes (I usually do 3.5 minutes with this tea) will activate the \"calmer\" side of teas.<br /><br />I recommend Taylors of Harrogate Earl Grey whole-heartedly - but I guess that is self-evident, too! :-)',\n",
       " 'I am a Lapsang Souchong fan.  This variety has a good, strong smokey flavor.  This tea is not for the faint of heart but if you truly enjoy Lapsang Souchong taste this one.

Unlike other teas, it seems to stay smooth-tasting even when you make it strong and has a nice reddish color to it. I can't get enough of this tea.

       " 'I first heard about Lapsang Souchong while reading <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580087450\">The Story of Tea: A Cultural History and Drinking Guide</a>, where they described the history and manufacturing process for the unique tea, as well as saying that it\\'s strong smoky flavor had a \"love it or hate it\" reputation amongst tea drinkers. Well, my favorite beverage in the world is the Islay whisky Laphroaig, and I have heard those exact same terms used to describe its flavor many, many times.  I knew I had to give Lapsang Souchong a try.<br /><br />Of course, there are many Lapsang Souchong\\'s available, and it was really just a gamble to decide which one to chose.  I wanted a loose-leaf tea, since they tend to be of superior quality to tea bags.  I had heard the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JP6H2O\">Taylors of Harrogate Lapsang Souchong Loose Leaf</a> described as a \"beginner\\'s Lapsang Souchong,\" with a less-intense smokiness and I knew I didn\\'t want that.  If \"less-intense\" was what my palette demanded I wouldn\\'t reach for a bottle of Laphroaig!  Another reviewer recommended this China Mist product (sold under the name of their imprint company \"Leaves Pure Tea\") as being a good example of Lapsang Souchong.  The price and quantity were just right so this is what I picked.<br /><br />I am extraordinarily pleased with this purchase, and now am a dedicated fan of Lapsang Souchong.  The aroma is an intense smokiness, although the flavor is much more delicate.  I went with the recommended steeping time of five minutes in under-boiled water, and that seemed just about right.  If this tea is \"love it or hate it,\" I definitely fall into the \"love it\" category.<br /><br />The tea comes packed in an air-tight package with an oxygen-eater insert so it is as fresh as modern technology can make it.  The zip-lock bag is re-sealable, which is nice. I can\\'t find any details on the grade of the tea, or where is was processed but I assume for the price we are not dealing with a  top-quality first-flush product, but for something that has been smoked over pinewood for so long you don\\'t really need the most delicate leaves!<br /><br />Aside from enjoying a glass of Lapsang Souchong, it is really wonderful for cooking.  \"The Story of Tea\" has a Lapsang Souchong ice cream recipe that I want to try out, and I recently used some in a soup I was making as a replacement for liquid smoke.  It turned out fantastic, with the tea lending a complex smokiness to the dish.',\n",
       " 'Unlike most Stash teas, and most premium loose teas in general, this tea is not identified by a region of origin or a method of preparation.  Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a \"premium\" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don\\'t expect anything outstanding.',\n",

So I bought this to save money and found that this brand doesn't have quite the same richness.  I put 4 teaspoons in 16 Oz of water and brew it for 10 minutes and it lacks the flavor of a single bag of the Choice brand tea in the same amount of water.  I have even added extra to try and duplicate the flavor and it just isn't the same experience.  Don't get me wrong, this tea does not taste bad or anything like that, it is just different from what I expected and my only other experience with the Rooibos flavor was the Choice brand.  I am going to have to search around and see if I can find a loose tea with the same flavor as Choice.\",\n",

I've tried a handful of premium green teas imported from Japan on a very small scale.  These were all very good, but also quite expensive.

Green tea isn\\'t meant to be left in a teapot like english teas. So my first cup of green tea was actually a little stronger than I am used to and I actually got 3 uses out of ONE k-cup.

You can tell the old bags from the new by the wrappers: the good old ones were printed to match the box design, the bad new ones are just anonymous solid green.  I would never order it again.

The honey adds a nice complexity to the cup, but I'm also looking forward to adding a few cloves and cinnamon stick.  Many other uses for the crystals come to mind as well as simply dissolving in water -- I've been using it to sugar tea, both black and green, and I'll definitely try another reviewer's recommendation for strawberries or other fruit.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I wish the packet had somewhat less sugar (but with the same ginger and honey strength).  One packet, at 17 g, is getting a bit close to typical desert levels (I checked some sorbet in my frig, 23 g).<br /><br />That aside, I prefer this to the ginger tea I've been getting at a local Korean market, a kind of marmalade or jelly with ginger slices in a jar.

The description on the box labels it as a \"sweet and delicate tea with reddish colour\"... but personally, I have to disagree with that description.  It was more of a perfumed sweetness with a hint of bitter aftertaste, not delicate at all.  Everyone has different tastes and most likely I\\'m the odd one in the bunch.

When it is said that this cake can make 75 servings, what they really mean is that you can have 75 \"Gong-fu\" sessions with this tea.  This type of Chinese tea is typically put into very small Yixing teapots (approx 5-7gr of tea into a 110-120 ml teapot), rinsed once or twice (probably once for this expensive tea), and then poured into teacups.  A very high-quality Puerh (aged \"raw\", not aged \"cooked\") can make anywhere from 5-10 teapots-full of the tea before running out of leaf.  Sometimes even more.  Usually the desired effect of these very-old teas is not exactly how they taste, because often-times they won\\'t taste like much more than flavored water, but instead the \"Cha-Chi\", which is a type of energy or feeling that your body feels when/after drinking these teas.  The feelings can be anything from quite stimulating, to very soothing (almost narcotic).  There are many fakes in the market-place, due to extremely rare occurences of any REALLY good, old raw Puerh tea being found outside of Asia.  Any that are found will definitely command very high prices because this type of tea is usually hoarded in China, Taiwan, and anywhere else that anyone can find any of it available for purchase.  Also, when someone states \"60\\'s Puerh tea\", that is a whole decade of variance to deal with.  Before taking the plunge with Puerh tea, start doing your research.  Puerh tea has really been taking hold of the West in recent years, and now the East is capitalizing on our desires for really good Puerh teas.  There are some very good reliable sources out there, but it usually incurs a monetary learning-curve before you get the hang of who you can trust, and what Puerh teas may be right for you.  BUYER BEWARE!  I hope I am not overstepping any bounds by saying this, but a good place to start learning about Puerh tea would be \"Puerh Tea- A Westerner\\'s Quest\" website.

The first day or two of my period, I might have 5-6 cups of tea. This tea TASTES GREAT (not medicine-like at all) and you really can\\'t overdo it.

Anyone who has made southern sweet tea the old school way, knows that it takes a lot of time to get the consistency just right. Once that\\'s done the tea goes fast, thus the cycle continues. This tea is awesome!! Keurig makes it easy! Just keep in mind the K-cup is not REALLY sweet. Southerners call the tea itself \"SWEET\" not because of the suger but because of a particular taste. (This is a hard point to get across if you are not accustomed to drinking many different sweet teas down south) I use a glass pitcher, fill a fourth of the pitcher with sugar, then fill the entire pitcher with hot boiling water. Stir with a long spoon...(careful it will be HOT) until the water is completely clear. It\\'s what we call a SIMPLE SYRUP down south. Before you brew your K-Cup, drop a splash of simple syurp in your glass or over your ice. The Sweet Perfect Ice Tea will then truely be PERFECT! FYI: If you live up north like I do and crave ice tea all year round...You\\'d better stock up on your K-cups by end of summer.

It is a healthy alternative to black teas because it is naturally caffeine-free and loaded with antioxidants--as much as green tea. You can brew this tea for a long time and it will not get bitter because there are no tannins.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually.

Small foil packet that opens easily via a notch. Mix with water. Voila, a really nice cup of tea you can heat in the nuker if you like, or just go with it iced (or room temp) like I do.<br /><br />The tastes is very fresh, no bitterness (like I can get with making hot tea, cause I\\'m a tea idiot apparently). It mixes so well (no big clumps). Totally a quality product.<br /><br />I ordered three boxes the first time (August 12, 2008). I\\'m gonna order even more now, though I still have some left, just to have in stock in my pantry.<br /><br />Not only do I love this as a refreshing beverage (that can be punctuated with lime or lemon, or splashed with a healthful ounce or so of blueberry, cherry, acai, or pomegranate juice), but I started using it as my pre-workout caffeine punch. And know what: It works. Having this 35-40 minutes or so prior to my Pilates hour-long session makes me put in some extra effort so I\\'m wonderfully sore in the core the next day from the boost of energy.<br /><br />This is unsweetened (a plus), so you can sweeten it to your heart\\'s delight, with honey or stevia or, if you\\'re watching calories, Splenda or Equal. And, hey, yeah, sugar works, if you swing that sucrose way. And though I have a sweet tooth, I\\'ve been drinking this unsweetened.

The best part is that it's practically impossible to overbrew.  Jasmine Tea in particular can get really bitter easily if it is overbrewed even a bit and I was afraid I would have to take the flower out after a couple of minutes to stop the brewing process.  But NO!  The makers thought ahead and made it so that you can leave the flower in and it won't overbrew.  The only bad thing about this is that if you like your Jasmine Tea really strong then you won't like the way this works for you.  But strong Jasmine Tea is always bitter so you might want to try a lighter brew like this.<br />Hint: If you never liked the way Jasmine Tea tasted because of it's bitterness here's a trick.  Standard instructions for Jasmine include having your water at around 180 degrees and brewing for aprox 2 minutes.  Instead of this, try using a lower temperature instead- say 130ish and brew for 7 minutes.  What you'll get is a tea with all the Jasmine and none of the bitterness.  With these flowers however you don't have to worry about brewing time (unless you like your tea VERY weak) and are free to enjoy the flower until your tea is gone.\",\n",

Flavor was okay, but nothing special.<br />Jade Fortune was nothing special.  The bloom looked like a sea urchin - kind of interesting.  There was no real scent to it, and there was nothing special about the taste.  It was stronger with the second pot, which was unusual, but the tea wasn't tasty enough to brew the third pot.<br />Jasmine Pearls unwind to become long, thin leaves.  The scent is heavenly.  The taste is not quite as dramatic, but still good.  I used approximately 1 pearl for each cup of tea to brew it (3 pearls per pot).<br />Black Beauty looked like a sea urchin, and had a mild flavor and aroma.

Lidded Glass teapot to view the spectacular blooming.  2 attractive, reusable and sustainable bamboo boxes (1 containing the individually wrapped flowers and a larger containing the whole kit and caboodle.

The nay sayers are looking for a product that would have to retail at twice the full retail value of this set.  And you don\\'t like the flavors?  Isn\\'t that a matter of personal taste?

It is very nice to watch the tea fill the glass orb with color and flavor.  Whether the flowers are beautiful or look more like sea urchins will be a matter of personal taste.<br /><br />I had high hopes for the Starlight Rose Tea (white tea leaves with rosebud) and found it far inferior to Rose Petal Black Blended Tea by The Republic of Tea, which is excellent.

There is a category of \"medicinal\" herbal teas and some of them claim to help people experiencing problems with their libido, etc and I guess this reviewer felt that the name \"Passion\" should be reserved for such a tea. This is not that type of tea, so look elsewhere if that\\'s what you need.<br /><br />If you like tart, fruity teas, however, I heartily recommend it.',\n",
       " \"I admit it, I'm a tea snob. Tea isn't a beverage for me, it's an event, starting from boiling the water to when the last drop vanishes down my oesophagus.<br /><br />And as a snob, I don't buy bagged teas, I buy loose leaf. So I normally wouldn't have drank this tea, except that I filched a couple of complimentary bags while waiting interminably at the local dealership (OK, I drank one at the dealership and stole 3, one for each hour I was kept waiting).<br /><br />On the matter of taste, I find it very good. The Bigelow EG appeared to be very strong in color and taste.<br /><br />Tea bag teas are usually cut very fine so the tea bags can be packed flat, and because finely cut leaves have more surface area than big leaves, you don't need to steep the tea as long. In fact the instructions say to steep only 1-2 minutes as opposed to the usual 3-4 mins.<br /><br />To me, Earl Grey taste has two components, the tea taste and the bergamot taste, and it takes a lot of skill to blend and make a tea that has a pleasing combination of the two tastes.<br /><br />Taylors and Harrogate has a mild tea and bergamot taste. Whole Foods loose leaf has a strong bergamot taste. Your run of the mill EG usually has a strong tea taste that overshadows the bergamot and you don't taste it at all. Bigelow has a very strong tea taste, but it doesn't overwhelm the bergamot, which you taste at the end. So I like it very much, because I've never had a strong tea that didn't overwhelm the bergamot. And it's definitely not a mild tea, it's very robust and strong. It's not a light handshake, it's a full body hug and kisses on both cheeks when you drink this.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you want a very strongly flavored Earl Grey with a strong tea taste, but also a strong hint of bergamot, this is it, I'll definitely buy some (because I think they have security cameras in the waiting area).\",\n",
       " \"I received the old version of this as a gift (same set, different tea and the old perfect tea maker).<br />There is a few things here requiring review.<br /><br />Tea: The tea from Teavana is generally pretty tasty. They have some serious (high end) stuff, but mostly they have a lot of 'foofy' ones to try to get non-tea people to become 'tea people'. This is fine, and I actually enjoy a good bit of it as well. They are always changing the Tea provided with these sets, but generally you get a decent mate, a decent spiced roibos, and then either some foofy fruity ones or some black/earl grey. Overall as long as you're getting someone flavors they will enjoy the tea is great. [some of it has way too much fruity stuff for me, but I enjoy some of the simpler fruit ones with only a couple flavors].<br /><br />Tea spoon: actually, this tea spoon is a bit larger than a measuring tea spoon, but it is wonderful for tea. This is one thing I thoroughly miss when I make tea at work or somewhere besides my kitchen.<br /><br />Tea maker: the old one was good, but left a bit to be desired. I own the new one (in this set) now as well and it is really awesome. Very sturdy, good quality, easy to clean, you can read my review on it's product page.<br /><br />Sugar: the sugar is good quality, but generally a bad deal.<br />A note on Teavana's use of sugar: if you tried the tea at the store, it generally (not always) has a ton (4+ scoops) of this sugar or honey in it. They make it very sweet at the store so it tastes like juice and more people will buy it. If you're getting tea to avoid sugar/additives make sure you like it without the sugar. If you don't mind a ton of sugar, scoop away and this bag should last through most of the tea provided. (I personally like tea with a little or no sweetening so figuring out if I like a tea is difficult at the store...) I mention this because a lot of people I know like a tea at Teavana, buy it and complain that it doesn't taste good.<br /><br />The cans: the small cans are pretty awesome. I use their bigger cans for my regular tea supply, but I still use the small ones to take tea to work or on trips.<br /><br />Overall, I think the kit is a pretty bad deal since you get 4 of their cheaper teas (and can't pick) and the sugar (which you might not want). I was excited to receive this as a gift, though I didn't really enjoy all the tea in mine. I think if you wanted to get a tea lover a gift like this is would make more sense to buy the tea maker, the spoon, and a few teas they might like for about the same price. If this has everything you want, it is on par with Teavanas usual pricing.<br /><br />My opinion of Teavana is less than favorable, due to pricing, selling techniques,customer service and a handful of other reasons. However, their products are nice, and their tea (even the foofy stuff) is pretty good quality and a good way to introduce someone to tea.\",\n",

       " \"After trying about 30 different brands of Green Tea, I have found this to be the best tasting. This Green Tea is a blend of Japanese Green Teas, which are more robust and flavourful than typical Chinese Greens. The only Green Tea I've tasted that compares is straight Yama Moto Yama from Japan. I believe Yama Moto Yama is also in the Stash blend.<br /><br />As far as Green Teas go, this blend is among the naturally sweetest and has no bitterness... unless you overcook it. The trick I have found to getting the best flavour from Green Teas is not using too high a temperature to steep it. Steep at a lower temp (170F-180F) for a longer time which will result in a tea that is actually green in colour, not brown or gold. Also, this tea tastes best as is, don't put any sweeteners in it like sugar or honey. If you are addicted to sugar, ween yourself off of it and enjoy the great flavour of this premier Green Tea.<br /><br />Of course, Green Tea is incredibly healthy, rich in anti-oxidants and relaxing theanine, is not harmfully acidic like coffee and there is also one quarter the amount of caffiene than in coffee - easier to brew too!<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable considering the quality of tea you are getting. Better yet, buy it in bulk for great savings.<br /><br />If you want to be even healthier, Stash also sells their Premium Green Tea in organic form for only a few more pennies per bag.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!\",\n",

The glowing reviews here sealed my decision...but alas, I sadly haven't found this to be as wonderful as they did. I find this tea to be pretty bland no matter how little or long I steep it, and there's barely a trace of either mint to be detected.

I drink green tea for the health benefits, and have been drinking various kinds for about ten years now.  Before I found this kind, I would choke down regular green (which tastes like hay!) and tried all of the flavored kinds.  Most of the teas would hurt my stomach if I drank them in the morning on an empty stomach.  Moroccon mint doesn't bother my tummy at all.  In fact, If I have an upset stomach or feel really full, this tea actually calms it.  I drink two talls of this tea a day.  I am thirty years old, but I hear everyday that I look like I am in my early 20's.  People quite literally don't believe that I am 30.  I really think a lot of this has to do with the powerful health benefits.  Beyond this, I am around children all the time as I nanny for a side job, and am never sick.  I would highly recommend this tea, and I have tried them all! But please don't order a bunch because I don't want it to be out of stock!  ha ha!

       " 'I converted to drinking only loose leaf tea last year and gave this gift pack a try. While it was decent, I have since had better and will probably not be ordering it again.<br /><br />For one, it is impossible to tell the age of the teas in the tins. For Pu-erh, that\\'s not such a big deal, but for green teas and the Jasmine, you want normally want to get a batch that is a fresh as possible. PierMall is a big reseller of products from around the world, and there is no telling how long what you get had been sitting in some huge warehouse, slowly losing flavor. Another consideration is that you get a random sampling of Chinese teas, no the specific types that is implied by their Amazon listing. If you visit their website, you will see that they draw from this selection:<br /><br />* China Black Tea<br />* Tiekuanyin (Iron Goddess of Mercy)<br />* Oolong<br />* Lung Ching DragonWell Green Tea<br />* Yunnan Pu-erh<br />* Jasmine Tea<br />* White Tea<br />* PuErh Tea with Chrysanthmum<br />* Lychee Black Tea<br />* Rose Black Tea<br />* Rose Green Tea<br />* Osthsmum Green Tea<br /><br />I don\\'t know about you, but I\\'d like a little more certainty when buying a product. If you are new to tea and trying different varieties out, or are getting this as a gift, then it isn\\'t such a big deal. Of what I received, the Oolong was the best. The Pu-erh was okay, though nothing special, and the Jasmine has a slight aftertaste, leading me to believe it was artificially flavored. Good Jasmine tea should be flavored by the scent of the flower, nothing else. The green and blacks were just okay.<br /><br />You could do worse if you were to buy teabags, but not much. I would recommend buying good loose leaf tea from dedicated tea vendors who are more upfront about what exactly they are selling you. At this price, you really can\\'t expect to get quality tea. But if you are looking for an inexpensive gift for someone who doesn\\'t know their tea, you could do worse. At least afterward you have some cute little tins in which to store future teas! It may cost a little more, but I think one would be much better served by ordering samples from a company like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YT18B4\">Heavenly Teas</a> or Adagio.',\n",

       " 'I have been drinking Good Earth Decaf Green Tea for many years and it is my favorite tea. This tea is not purely green tea leaves - it also contains lemongrass and other flavors. It is flavorful but mild. Ingredients: Decaffeinated Green Tea, Lemongrass, Natural Flavors (Contains Soy Lecithin), Rose Petals and Peppermint.<br /><br />Be aware that the Good Earth Decaf Green Tea does not have the more delicate flavor as real Japanese green tea (and not a roasted flavor like Genmai), but it is great as an everyday tea. If you are expecting green tea like in Japanese restaurants, this is not it - if you want that, get high quality loose tea leaves and brew it with the correct temperature water in a teapot. (Although maybe the Good Earth green tea would taste more similar to Japanese green tea if brewed like Japanese green tea should be - read on...)<br /><br />I often leave my tea bag steeping for a long time (I know, not recommended for green tea, but it likely does extract more of the beneficial antioxidants), up to 30 min, and this tea does not get bitter. It also does not get bitter if the tea sits around before drinking. One Good Earth tea bag works fine for my large 16 oz mug. I have found that other brands of tea can be weak and not flavorful if using only one bag for 16 oz water.<br /><br />I also like that this tea is decaf since even the smaller amount of caffeine in green tea affects me. Decaf green teas are somewhat hard to find. This company uses a CO2 process for decaffeination, preferable to a solvent extraction process.<br /><br />Note that this product is available in 18-count and 25-count boxes.<br /><br />I have tried many other brands of green tea (decaf and regular) over the years and keep coming back to Good Earth brand.

Also, you don't need much to make a couple usable infusions.<br /><br />Flowery and light, this tea smells, looks, and tastes fresh in every cup.  It would be easy to overload with the amount of tea used... so try no more than a pinch for a 12 oz cup.

While I was a bit skeptical of the five calories proposed for each 8-ounce serving, seeing as how honey is a fairly high caloric sweetener, I figured I'd give it a go anyway. So after receiving the tea, I mixed it up per the instructions and took a sip. Yowzas! The tea was super sweet with a bit of strawberry flavor and no tea that I could taste. I ended up watering the tea down enough that one packet, which is usually two servings, ends up as four or five 8-oz. servings. The berry flavor became very diluted while there was still that taste of icky sweetness. Overall the berry flavors and tea are weak, even undiluted, and I noticed no honey flavor what-so-ever, so took a look-see at the ingredients where I spotted sucralose (an artificial sweetener) thrown right in the middle of things. Now that is where the sweetness is and don't take kindly to that addition, as I avoid artificial sweeteners whenever possible. Seeing as how Lipton is sneakily claiming this is sweetened with honey (And look! NO aspartame!), with no mention that in actuality the sweeteners are honey granules, which are made from both honey and sugar, and sucralose except by viewing the ingredients list, makes me angry because I've been swindled. Yeah, this is natural all right. I'm definitely not going to trust Lipton's marketing from now on and urge them to think about switching to a natural sweetener such as stevia. So if you like your food natural, best to skip this, but if you're not so picky and don't mind artificial sweeteners in your food, then give it a go if you're interested.

I do not use artificial sweeteners and avoid artificially sweetened beverages because I do not like the flavor, not for health reasons.<br /><br />I used one packet per 24 oz bottle of water and I am sure that if I were to mix it per instructions it would be way too sweet.  I was not able to taste honey or pomegranate.  Blackberry is somewhat pronounced, although not as a natural but as an artificial blackberry flavor.<br /><br />I also had a problem with packaging.  When I tore the corner of a packet at notch, the resulting hole was too small for the contents to pour out.  I had to jiggle the packet and push the contents out.  That created a cloud of fine dust which I inhaled - not pleasant.  I struggled with the second packet as well.  It is possible that it is just the batch I received that did not have the tear notch punched properly.<br /><br />The description says \"Sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors.\" I am surprised this kind of marketing is allowed or tolerated.  It is just as much (probably more if you consider contribution to the total sweetness) sweetened with artificial sweeteners as it is with honey.  As for the green tea or pomegranate flavor...  Who can tell that this tastes anything like either one of those things?  It seems like a manufacturer can show to a cousin of a random employee a picture of tea leaves and pomegranates and let them listen to bees buzzing and then claim that the product was made with tea leaves, honey, and real pomegranate flavor.<br /><br />I would not buy this product the way it currently is.',\n",

Well, not with this tea. :)<br /><br />The packaging is cute, it comes in the pink tin pictured here.  It has a metal lid that screws on/off.  Inside there is another lid (made of flexible plastic) to help keep the tea fresh.

Since white tea is much lighter & more delicate than green tea too much jasmine would probably overpower it.  Strong jasmine flavor or not, this tea is yummy. All i know is that i enjoyed everything about brewing & drinking this tea.  It is well packaged, has a pleasing aroma & flavor, and the leaves seem to be rolled with meticulous care.

Catnip is a calming, safe, and mild sedative.\" ~ pg. 36 of God\\'s Healing Herbs by Dennis Ellingson<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings has a few wellness teas for soothing your soul. Tension Tamer Extra has a lemony herbal flavor. Peppermint, cinnamon, lemongrass, lemon flavor, ginger root, licorice, vitamin C, B6, B12, Eleuthero, Chamomile, Tilia estrella, lemon verbena, catnip and roasted chicory make this earthy and lemony with calming power.<br /><br />Licorice is believed to have stress reducing properties and lemongrass makes this a lemony herb tea. Eleuthero, also known as \"Siberian Ginseng\" is a stress reliever but can also help improve concentration. This tea is not for children or for anyone with heart problems or high blood pressure.<br /><br />Tension Tamer Extra seems to have two effects, first it calms you down emotionally and then it wakes you up intellectually. This tea might be good to drink in the evening if you want to feel peaceful, but you are not quite ready to fall asleep.

       " 'This is my favorite of the currently (1/2007) available K-Cup Earl Grey teas.  To calibrate this review to your tastes: (1) I like *tea*, plus this one flavoring, not herbs with a little bit of tea -- I\\'m even finicky about how much Bergamot gets put in.  (2) I prefer Twinings to Stash (in bags, not available in K-Cups) for that very reason.  Twinings is sightly less expensive than Gloria Jean\\'s or Celestial Seasonings, and has the \"cleanest\" taste of the three.  If you like a \"brighter\" or more flowery taste, go for the Celestial Seasonings; or if you like a more \"complex\" or \"spicy\" taste, choose the Gloria Jean\\'s.',\n",
       " \"I really enjoy tea, and especially Earl Grey. I do not drink coffee, soda or anything else other then tea and water. So I find myself drinking lots of tea.<br /><br />When I purchased my Keurig, I also bought a selection of teas from Celestial Seasonings, which included their Earl Grey and English Breakfast. After using them up, I decided to try the Earl Grey from Twinings for K-cups but was disappointed. The flavor was quite weak, not to say everyone likes a strong tea, but those who enjoy the sophisticated taste of Earl Grey, often like it to have a bolder taste then what this produced. Also it left a lot of unpleasant tea powder at the bottom of the tea cup which gave the cup of tea an unappealing appearance of being dirty.<br /><br />I would have just assumed that this was the best a Keurig maker could do to produce a cup of tea if I hadn't already had 2 boxes of Celestial Seasoning teas that produced stronger tea with no muddy appearance. I was quite surprised with this result because I ordered the Twinings tea with the assumption that it would be better then the Celestial Seasoning.<br /><br />Not my favorite K-cup tea for the Keurig.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'m clearly in the minority here, as Darjeeling is not one of my favorite Bigelow varieties.  It is a good tea, and I enjoy drinking it, and I would never be unhappy if someone served it to me.  In fact, I do keep some in my house, and brew up a cup every couple weeks or so.  But Darjeeling isn\\'t one of my top tier Bigelow favorites, and there are several others I drink more frequently.<br /><br />This is strictly a black tea (which is what I most prefer), without any additions, although when I do my teabag deep sniff (my favorite moment with any tea, right after I rip open a foil bag!) with Darjeeling, there is a hint of what is almost a lemon scent.  There is no lemon added to this tea, but it\\'s interesting that the scent is there, particularly as another reviewer says this is the only tea he doesn\\'t \"have\" to add lemon to.<br /><br />The flavor is quite good, but my main complaint is that it is weaker, or more mellow, than I prefer.  When I drink Darjeeling, I find myself wishing there was more of the flavor present.  It is often described as \"rich\" or \"robust\" but I think there are other straight black teas that better meet those terms.<br /><br />If you also find Darjeeling a little mellow for your tastes, I suggest you try the Bigelow English Breakfast (don\\'t confuse this with the Bigelow English Teatime!) variety, which is also a straight black tea.<br /><br />I always drink tea straight--no sugar, no honey, no lemon, no milk!  So my reviews are my opinions of the straight tea flavor, not how it interacts with another agent.  I drink Bigelow tea almost exclusively, because it\\'s readily available, modestly priced, and has lots of varieties that are all of decent quality.  If I give a Bigelow flavor less stars, it reflects only my taste preference, and is not a statement of low product quality.',\n",

Oolong is rich in antioxidants called polyphenols, which is found to be associated with weight loss.  Another important constituent is epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which has been extensively studied as a potential treatment for a variety of diseases, including cancer.

This Green Tea is a blend of Japanese Green Teas, which are more robust and flavourful than typical Chinese Greens. The only Green Tea I've tasted that compares is straight Yama Moto Yama from Japan. I believe Yama Moto Yama is also in the Stash blend.<br /><br />As far as Green Teas go, this blend is among the naturally sweetest and has no bitterness... unless you overcook it. The trick I have found to getting the best flavour from Green Teas is not using too high a temperature to steep it. Steep at a lower temp (170F-180F) for a longer time which will result in a tea that is actually green in colour, not brown or gold. Also, this tea tastes best as is, don't put any sweeteners in it like sugar or honey. If you are addicted to sugar, ween yourself off of it and enjoy the great flavour of this premier Green Tea.<br /><br />Of course, Green Tea is incredibly healthy, rich in anti-oxidants and relaxing theanine, is not harmfully acidic like coffee and there is also one quarter the amount of caffiene than in coffee - easier to brew too!<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable considering the quality of tea you are getting. Better yet, buy it in bulk for great savings.<br /><br />If you want to be even healthier, Stash also sells their Premium Green Tea in organic form for only a few more pennies per bag.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!\",\n",

I'd been wanting the benefits of green tea again anyway, and this seemed the ideal mix of the two, with the added bonus of peppermint and lemongrass. The glowing reviews here sealed my decision...but alas, I sadly haven't found this to be as wonderful as they did. I find this tea to be pretty bland no matter how little or long I steep it, and there's barely a trace of either mint to be detected.

Before I found this kind, I would choke down regular green (which tastes like hay!) and tried all of the flavored kinds.  Most of the teas would hurt my stomach if I drank them in the morning on an empty stomach.  Moroccon mint doesn't bother my tummy at all.  In fact, If I have an upset stomach or feel really full, this tea actually calms it.  I drink two talls of this tea a day.  I am thirty years old, but I hear everyday that I look like I am in my early 20's.  People quite literally don't believe that I am 30.  I really think a lot of this has to do with the powerful health benefits.  Beyond this, I am around children all the time as I nanny for a side job, and am never sick.  I would highly recommend this tea, and I have tried them all! But please don't order a bunch because I don't want it to be out of stock!  ha ha!

The cost is honestly too steep for me to buy other better rated matcha for the flavor, so I'm happy I can get this much tea for the price (I've got 3 kids & a lot of other priorities; maybe when I retire...). And for the price, I'm getting all the health benefits of any other matcha (you get all the antioxidants out of matcha since you ingest the whole leaf; brewing teas often makes the extracted antioxidants bitter), plus I don't feel too guilty using it on my face, either. Perfectly nice matcha for the beginner & the frugal. Gave some to my sister, also a novice to matcha, & she loved it too. Worth a try for the price.\",\n",

Japanese often drink it with tiny sugar candies to offset the bitterness.  Matcha also contains a lot of antioxidants so it may be helpful to some to stat incorporating it into their diet.

There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a \"premium\" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don\\'t expect anything outstanding.',\n",

After some research, I found out that there are several \"natural\" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using \"natural\" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.

There are a few specialty retailers in the USA that now offer the PG Tips Special Blend Tea and hopefully Amazon will do so soon.<br /><br />In the 1930s (the pre-digestive era in history) this tea was introduced by the name \"Pre-Gest-Tee\" suggesting the tea could be consumed before food was eaten, but it was the grocers who gave it the abbreviation of \"PG\" - and the company added \"tips\" (since the company uses only the best part of the tea plant, the two top leaves and bud of the tea plant to make the tea).<br /><br />Many black teas sold in the USA are graded the basic medium grade Orange Pekoe (generally the tea leaves below the top two and bud), which is one of the reasons PG Tips gets higher reviews than most other teas.  PG Tips also uses their pyramid tea bag that allows ample room for the tea to expand as it is infused.  Additionally, in my opinion, PG Tips blends only two blends, rather than blending a wide assortment, thus becoming really good at what they do.<br /><br />Here at Amazon PG Tips is priced at just over a nickel a tea bag (a good value for an imported product) when you order the 240 count boxes in a set of two, and even less expensive in the higher volumes.  PG Tips makes wonderful ice tea too, and that\\'s good news since Americans drink about 80% of their tea as iced tea and only 20% as hot tea.  Worldwide more hot tea is consumed than iced tea, and worldwide tea is the most consumed beverage (next to water), while in the USA it is the sixth most consumed beverage (next to water).<br /><br />A very good question to ponder is \"Why this is?\"<br /><br />Drinking an adequate amount of tea daily is now being considered to be very good for one\\'s health, and it is much more enjoyable to drink a really good cuppa (cup of tea), especially at the nominal cost of about a nickel a cup when compared to one of those gourmet coffee places who charge upwards of four to five dollars for a large cup of coffee.<br /><br />When we have a guest in our home we always offer them a PG Tips cuppa, and they always say they have never tasted a tea this good - thus, I rate it 5 stars for its quality and very nominal price!',\n",

Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area\\'s gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself \"home of silk and tea\" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name \"gunpowder\" derives from the tea\\'s elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets.

Not only is Sleepytime caffeine-free but it contains herbs that are mildly relaxing and healing for the stomach. Drink this lovely tea before bed either with or without honey.<br /><br />Sleepytime contains chamomile, spearmint, lemongrass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorne berries and rosebuds. The healing qualities of some the herbs in Sleepytime are listed below, however please note that there is insufficient quantities of each herb to have anything more than a very mild effect. Blackberry leaves, which are soothing to the stomach, contain tannins which provides a tea-like base for the flowery flavors of chamomile and rosebuds. Spearmint is one of the milder mints and is also useful to soothe tummy ache. Chamomile is a wonderful herb that has a relaxing effect; it also can be used to soothe tummy aches, headache, menstrual cramps and is a mild anti-fungal.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don\\'t package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag.

I hope Amazon will start having the Subscribe & Save option for this product like other Yogi teas.<br /><br />[UPDATE: Oct 12, 2011]<br />Amazon now offers Subscribe & Save option! :-)<br /><br />I extracted description/effects of the top 3 ingredients (Green Tea Leaf, Lemongrass, and Blackberry Leaf) that contains the most in each tea bag as well as some other ingredients that Yogi Tea claims to play an important role in this product.<br /><br />Green Tea Leaf:<br />- contains the most antioxidant polyphenols, which are responsible for its many health benefits.<br />- is a more potent antioxidant than broccoli, carrots, spinach or strawberries.<br />- enhances immunity and benefit oral health.<br />- balance total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, as well as triglycerides, and to support a healthy ratio of LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol.<br /><br />Lemongrass:<br />- supports mucous membrane function, and it is used to promote sweating.<br />- is a warming herb that speeds digestion and reduces gas and nausea.<br /><br />Blackberry Leaf:<br />- its vitamin C and tannins in the leaves helps boost immunity and heal wounds.<br />- contains ellagic acid, which is a powerful cell protector and antioxidant.<br />- is a source of mild astringent compounds (tannins), which tighten up and dry out loose, soggy tissue (so blackberry leaf has been used traditionally to ease minor sore throat, diarrhea and skin rashes).<br /><br />Devil\\'s Claw Root Extract:<br />- Native to southern Africa<br />- is a shrub that has lush foliage and red flowers (The plant gets its name from its fruits, which look like a hooked, gnarled claw).<br />- Historically, African people have employed the root for a wide range of conditions; from digestive function to joint support.<br />- Since its introduction to Europe in the early 1900s, the use of devil\\'s claw root has spread throughout the world, and continues to be used primarily for joint support.<br /><br />Yucca Root-Herbs:<br />- A desert plant that grows in the Southwestern part of the United States and in Mexico.<br />- is a Native American remedy used to soothe irritation of all sorts, and to support healthy joints and skin.<br />- The main nutritional agents are saponins, which have a soapy consistency. Native Americans used yucca as soap due to its lathering effect and also as a blood cleanser.<br /><br />Ginseng-Eleuthero Extract:<br />- is not a true ginseng, but a cousin of Asian ginseng.<br />- has gained that nickname due to the fact that Siberian natives use it as a broad spectrum health enhancer, much the way ginseng is used.<br />- has a long-term stamina enhancing effect.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS (as it appears on the product package):<br />Organic Green Tea Leaf, Organic Lemongrass, Organic Blackberry Leaf, Natural Lotus Flower Flavor, Rose Petal, Organic Skullcap Leaf, Organic Lemon Myrtle, Organic Turmeric Root, Yucca Root Extract, Ginseng-Eleuthero Extract (Panax ginseng, Panax quinquefolium, Eleutherococcus senticosu), Stevia Leaf, Cat\\'s Claw Bark Extract (Uncaria tomentosa, Phenols 15%, Alkaloids 3%), Devil\\'s Claw Root Extract.<br /><br />PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:<br />Stay active with a cup of Green Tea Muscle Recovery(tm). Our satisfying blend starts with gently stimulating and antioxidant-rich organic green tea and combines it with traditional soothing herbs such as organic turmeric root, one of the most widely used herbs in India. We then add devil\\'s claw root and yucca root--herbs from indigenous herbal traditions--to help decrease recovery time from the minor aches and pains that may result from exercise. What\\'s more, ginseng-eleuthero extract helps you reenergize.* So get invigorated, be energized, and stay active with Green Tea Muscle Recovery!<br /><br />[Above information extracted from Yogi Website: [...]]<br /><br />[Edit: It seems I can not post Yogi web address on Amazon review.

It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth.<br /><br />I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.<br /><br />Alvita uses minimal packaging.

This is a strong fullbodied tea but a little more mild than most Irish teas.  Some may like that.  Its very drinkable, with or without milk or sugar.  All Twinings loose leaf teas are actually coarsely ground rather than full leafs.  The tea will brew quicker but bits of leaf particles can get into your cup.  I use a tea strainer and still some small amount will go into the cup.  There isnt a lot but something to be aware of.<br /><br />It comes in an attractive green-and-gold tin cannister, as the picture shows.  Very attractive but something that is not really needed if you have, or can buy, your own tea container.  The tea is sealed with tin foil to keep freshness and brewing instructions are printed in several languages on the tin foil.  It can be difficult to read the instruction if you need to do that.  THe packaging makes a nice presentation for gift-giving.<br /><br />I recently bought a package of Davidson's Organic Irish Tea, also from Amazon.  I like it better. Cheaper, full leafs, fuller richer and a bit stronger taste.  But Twinings Irish Tea can be good also.  Its a decent tea and one of the most famous names in tea companies.\",\n",
       " \"I figured my supply may need a boost. After looking at my choices, I purchased Yogi. It really is the best tea I've tasted so far. I admit that I drink alot simply because I love the taste. I don't know how well it helped my supply, but I have been nursing my 10mo every 3-4 hrs without problems.<br /><br />I think that just taking in the extra fluids helps. If you are having a big dip in your milk supply I would suggest taking Fenugreek capsules. Makes you smell like maple syrup, but really works. Fenugreek in combination with this tea should help supply issues. I'd continue drinking the tea long after supply is back to normal, sort of insurance. Oatmeal has been said to help too.<br /><br />If your supply is causing nursing problems or concerning you, please contact your lactation consultant or midwife. With help a low supply really can be fixed.<br /><br />Good luck and happy nursing!\",\n",

The strings appear to be sealed into the bag and when they get into a boiling cup of water, they tend to come off and the top of the bag opens and the tea leaves come out.  Ok, but I wouldn\\'t give it as a gift or anything.  I suggest sticking with a better brand for bagged teas like Lipton, Bigelow, or Celestial Seasonings.

I use K-cups at work because we have no facility for rinsing/cleaning/getting water for a regular machine.<br /><br />Sumatran coffees generally have a very rich, earthy taste; some would describe it as being \"tangy\" almost. Having tried the two other main brands of Sumatran for K-cups, the Puck is by far the best. It is not as bold as something you would get from Starbucks or from roasting yourself, but it has all the flavor elements of a good Sumatran cup. It especially has that nice earthy taste. Even the aftertaste is rich.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: If you are looking for a k-cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting, this coffee is not for you. In my opinion you get a Sumatran because you love strong coffee. Watered down it loses its distinctiveness. Get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor. I make mine with 2 k-cups, at the smallest setting. By camparison, I would give a Starbucks Sumatra mandheling a 10/10 rating for boldness.

       " 'I love the rich, full-bodied flavor of a dark-roast coffee.  When I bought my first Keurig machine I wasted no time in ordering all of the dark roast K-cups that I could find.  I initially settled on Newman\\'s Own Dark Roast as my \"go-to\" coffee, but I didn\\'t stop there.  I like to keep experimenting and looking for something new.  I happened to find Coffee People\\'s Organic Extra Bold blend and was blown away.  It has been my favorite ever since I first tried it.  Last week I saw a listing for a Colombian dark roast sold under the Wolfgang Puck name (it is processed and distributed by Van Houtte) and decided to give it try.  Here is my impression of it:<br /><br />After brewing a cup (I used the 7 1/2 oz. setting) the first thing that I noticed was that it didn\\'t have that freshly-brewed aroma that the Coffee People X-Bold does, however the taste was another story.  It hits your palate with medium acidity and a nice, sharp bite that gets your attention right away. The finish was surprising clean with a hint of spice (nutmeg or cinnamon?) and just a slight, lingering, pleasant bitterness.  I really like this coffee but I think that I will stick with Coffee People\\'s Extra Bold and this will be my back-up brand.  However, I will keep looking for something new.  Who knows what I will find?<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7GYY\">Newman\\'s Own&iquest; Organics Special Blend (Extra Bold), K-cups For Keurig Brewers, 24-count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L444OQ\">Coffee People Organic, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]',\n",

On the plus side, it is a smooth coffee and not acidic at all.<br /><br />A better choice, in my opinion, is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC\">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast, Extra Bold for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>, which also comes in the 50 pack.<br /><br />ADDED: Another nice, smooth medium blend is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002APWQ0K\">Timothy\\'s World Coffee, Kona Blend for Keurig Brewers, Medium, 50-Count K-Cups</a><br /><br />ADDED: for those who prefer a lighter smooth blend, try <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00196QVPM\">Keurig Green Mountain Coffee Roasters 80 K - Cup Colombian Fair Trade Slect Medium Roast Coffee</a> (link for product description only, not for best pricing).',\n",
       " 'First you must know I am one who roasts my own green beans at home, including Sumatran, but also many African varieties. I like a STRONG cup of coffee. I use K-cups at work because we have no facility for rinsing/cleaning/getting water for a regular machine.<br /><br />Sumatran coffees generally have a very rich, earthy taste; some would describe it as being \"tangy\" almost. Having tried the two other main brands of Sumatran for K-cups, the Puck is by far the best. It is not as bold as something you would get from Starbucks or from roasting yourself, but it has all the flavor elements of a good Sumatran cup. It especially has that nice earthy taste. Even the aftertaste is rich.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: If you are looking for a k-cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting, this coffee is not for you. In my opinion you get a Sumatran because you love strong coffee. Watered down it loses its distinctiveness. Get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor. I make mine with 2 k-cups, at the smallest setting. By camparison, I would give a Starbucks Sumatra mandheling a 10/10 rating for boldness. The Puck is about an 8, the Diedrich is a 4.<br />I highly recommend this coffee for bold coffee lovers, provided you use the smallest cup setting. You will not be disappointed. Best K-cup I have had yet, and I have tried many- Newman, Timothy\\'s, Donut Shop, Diedrich, etc.<br /><br />Addendum: I have since tried th Green Mountain Sumatran, and gave that a one -star.

When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it\\'s really a \"to each his or her own\" thing. But I\\'ve tried \\'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril\\'s Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril\\'s Big Easy Bold.

I\\'ve tried the \"Midnight Magic\" brand; I\\'ve tried the \"Jet Fuel\" brand; I\\'ve tried the \"Donut Shop\" brand; I\\'ve tried all of the \"Extra Bolds\"; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril\\'s Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What\\'s really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril\\'s Big Easy Bold, you won\\'t lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril\\'s.<br /><br />There is no question here.

Only 1 of 3 k-cups did not do this.  It is specifically this brand/packaging, since I was making other varieties of k-cup coffee in the same coffee maker in the same time and none of those broke the seal and left grounds all in the coffee maker.<br />Looking at the seal on this product, compared to other K-cups varieties, this seal is MUCH tighter, and since there is a larger amount of coffee grounds in this k-cup, there's a lot more to make a mess!<br />Loved the taste of the coffee, but can't waste so much time cleaning up the coffee pot!

Then due to the economy I needed to scale back, so I tried Folgers Black Silk after seeing an ad (this is when it was first launched).  I became immediately hooked and it is now the only coffee I drink when I brew at home.  If you use a French Press, you're in for a treat.  Black Silk excretes a delightful nutty oil when allowed to steep that those using filtered brewers will miss out on.  This coffee is strong, deep, dark, smooth, and delicious.\",\n",

I get her a couple of boxes a month and she loves it.  I have tried it and here is my take on this blend:<br /><br />The body (or \"mouth-feel\") is light to medium.  The acidity is medium-low so it won\\'t have too much of a bite, especially of you use cream.  The flavor is surprisingly complex with some spice (maybe cardamom or anise and a little pepper) as well as a rich coffee finish.  This will not replace my favorite dark roasts but I will keep it on hand for those guests who find a \"Starbucks-type\" of coffee too strong or bitter.

This is smooth but with a nice \"coffee\" presence you can actually taste.  *Coffee* taste, not burned grounds!<br /><br />I highly recommend this if you\\'re *not* into the \"make your hair stand on end\" type of coffee. This review is based on using the \"medium\" size on the coffee machine.  You may get different results if you use the small or large dispenser sizes.',\n",

       " 'I was terribly excited when I heard that Nescaf&eacute; had finally decided to just touch on the idea of carrying a wide array of flavors and intensities for straight espresso (I\\'ve always been so jealous of Nespresso\\'s collection of capsules) by introducing a new single-shot Intenso. As I\\'ve been stuck making double-shots of their fairly disappointing <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FHZA\">Espresso</a> option for ages, I\\'ve decided to do a little comparison in reviewing this new and exciting addition.<br /><br />This is what we\\'re working with: the Espresso has 6g of coffee in each capsule, while the Dark Roast Caff&eacute; Grande has 10g. As I noted in my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FI0O\">Latte Macchiato</a> review: a generally accepted typical single shot of espresso is made up of 8g of ground coffee with the final shot sitting at no more than 35mL. The Espresso\\'s instructions recommend ending up with 60mL of liquid, which seems to be a light amount of coffee for so much water (the Dark Roast doesn\\'t do much better, recommending 200mL for 10g). For my taste-tests, I was able to pump out a fairly heavy 50mL single-shot espresso, while I kept the Dark Roast to about 150-160mL<br />(NOTE: the tips I give in the previously mentioned Macchiato review for really squeezing every mg of coffee out of these capsules I have a feeling only work with the Dolce Gusto machines that allow you to completely control the flow; while my machine has that ball-point silver lever pointing up out of the head of the dispenser (like the Melody 2 and Circolo), it seems the machines Nescaf&eacute; just released this past month (specifically the Creativa) are somewhat automated).<br /><br />Right off the bat, as I dispense the Grande I notice the thicker, creamier color and texture of the coffee, which it retains for a good 30 seconds until it settles into a deep brown with even less noticeable light passing through (compared to the Espresso). Even though my pour started pushing 160 mL, the thickness is far greater than the Espresso, with absolutely no hint of water. Literally, the liquid itself feels heavier and richer in your mouth. The Espresso just pales in comparison in regard to taste, aroma, and texture. I\\'m definitely not an expert when it comes to pinpointing descriptive flavors in espressos, but I\\'d say the espresso here has something between a sweet and bitter dominating taste. On the other hand, the Grande lacks any resemblance to the Espresso, and if anything I\\'d say there\\'s a warm, spicy flavor that mixes quite well with the overall dark roast qualities.<br />Ofcourse, to those who know anything (and definitely more than me) about coffee, you might just say, \\'Well, you\\'re comparing a dark roast to a regular espresso\\'. Yes, I guess I am, and thus I should expect these differences. However, for the past three years now Nescaf&eacute; has only had one option when it came to a strong single-shot, the Espresso (the other choices were Caff&eacute; Lungo and then the Americano, both of which got further and further from deep and strong drinks). So, I guess giving this new Caf&eacute; Grande Intenso a try has ultimately given me a worthwhile competing option for the espresso-based choices. And I can finally enjoy a drink from my machine that only requires one capsule (the espressos could only do the trick in double-shots). For those of you who\\'ve been in a similar situation, this review should give you an idea of what to expect (and what you\\'re missing out on!) with this new choice.<br /><br />As usual, buying the boxes from Amazon.com with the Subscribe and Save is the most inexpensive option I\\'ve found.<br />Also, make sure to sign-up online at Dolce Gusto\\'s website for the award points you get with every box. With a box of three from Amazon (through Subscribe and Save), AND factoring in the 5 (sometimes 10) award points you get with every box (with which you may eventually redeem Amazon gift cards), the price per box drops to a little over 6 dollars (compared to ~9 dollars a box at Sur la Table and other retailers).<br /><br />Nescaf&eacute; has finally entered the realm of differing strengths and flavors for its espresso line, and those who felt the brand\\'s mild espressos just weren\\'t quite hitting the spot, this is a must-have and will easily be my go-to single-shot drink from now on!',\n",

Normal flavor 2 pumps, chocolate often just 1 (it is strong), extra flavor or large cup might be 3.<br /><br />I mainly use these in coffee.  I've found flavored coffee just doesn't taste as good.  I talked to a friend who owns a coffee store and he said none of the coffee stores will use the flavored coffee because you just don't get a lot of the flavor, that is why they all use the syrups, more variety and better flavor.<br /><br />My main suggestion is to not be afraid of mixing the flavors, again a trick I saw in the coffee shops.  I found mixing the caramel and chocolate in my coffee with milk is as close to a starbucks latte that I can get.  I didn't like the raspberry much until I added a tiny bit of chocolate.  Wow chocolate covered raspberries!  This is great on vanilla ice Cream too.  So if you find you don't like one of the flavors, try adding a bit of another.\",\n",
       " \"Complex, maybe more nasal than some of the coffees I use in my Gaggia Classic.  There's almost none of the Ethiopian velvety-slick feel, it's almost all European in taste, meaning the flavor tones are more coffee and less fruit and chocolate, the mouthfeel is clean and not coating/cloying.  Great aroma from the crema, and great aftertaste, lasts twenty minutes or more easily.<br /><br />This makes a great straight doubleshot. I don't mix this one with milk/foam, it's good enough on it's own.  I never have an issue with grind, pour/pull rate, or crema production.<br /><br />Not overly caffeinated, it doesn't have Robusta, causes very little 'over the temple' headache when overpulled/thin/underdosed, it's pretty temperature-insensitive.<br /><br />While I do appreciate some other coffees with thicker mouthfeel and darker flavors (Klatch Belle Espresso, Black Cat), this coffee is lighter and more 'focused' in flavor than those.  I find I pull shots of this LaVazza about twice as often as I pull 'boutique' shots.<br /><br />Just solid coffee, and sets the bar for the standard bean I keep in my kitchen.\",\n",

While the smell and color are wonderful, we found the Tierra 100% arabica blend to be much more bitter than our regular blend, and even after we added cream or milk to our coffee we felt unable to continue to drink it, so we gave it away after only a few brews (we are straight espresso drinkers otherwise). We have now received our regular Super Crema again and couldn't be happier.\",\n",
       " 'I really enjoy coffee, and I have ever since my teenage years. My tastes have gradually evolved and escalated. The first to go was any kind of instant coffee. How anyone could drink that swill is beyond me. Next to go was any kind of additive, such as cream or sugar. The next to go was any kind of ground coffee in a can. Some is marginally OK, but compared to whole-bean coffee, it just doesn\\'t cut it. No, whole-bean coffee without any additives and ground on the spot is the only coffee I\\'ll drink, short of some kind of emergency.<br /><br />When It comes to whole-bean coffees, there\\'s quite an amazing variety. I found Trader Joe\\'s to have an excellent selection from all over the world, and the cost (on a per pound basis) was typically about 50% that of what you might expect to pay in the local super market. I particularly liked their Columbian Supremo. The problem is, the local Trader Joe\"s is a long way off and I sometimes run out between visits. Well, I\\'ve then picked up some large bags of beans, one of which was Starbucks French Roast, at my local Costco store and it was quite excellent. Starbucks is first rate, but tends to be somewhat pricey, even when purchased at Costco.<br /><br />Well, one day I discovered the Kirkland Signature House Blend bags of whole-bean coffee at Costco. In my opinion, Kirkland Signature products have always been of the highest quality but at a substantially reduced price. For example, this Kirkland coffee is almost half the cost (on a per pound basis) of Starbucks French Roast. But, right on the front of the Kirkland package it says \"Roasted by Starbucks Coffee Co.\" Hmmmm. I just had to try this one. Well, it\\'s excellent. It\\'s a little less robust than my Starbucks French Roast, but I prefer it that way. I\\'d say it\\'s first rate coffee at a bargain basement price. Buying whole-bean coffee at the local supermarket is now out of the question.<br /><br />Gary Peterson',\n",

I run an affiliate site, and it's like rolling dice every day to watch the product link change from available to unavailable.<br /><br />So, if you can get your hands on these, and you have a K-Cup brewer at home or at work, I seriously recommend that you try these out. They're a dark roast, which is my only problem with them (darker roasts have less caffeine because it breaks down under the heat of roasting). The fact that they're organic AND fair trade is a huge bonus as well. I'm glad that I don't have to wonder what chemicals are put on the beans and that I know that the farmers were paid fairly for their goods. Sustainability means a lot to me, in the environmental AND human sense.<br /><br />The flavor is heavy and rich but smoother than you would expect. There's just a hint of acid bite in the after-taste that I associate with all of the K-Cup coffees. I drink it black, but it's certainly full-bodied enough to handle even heavy cream. If you take sugar, it will probably bring out the woody flavor that this coffee has. It might even hold up to honey or fructose for the diabetics in the crowd.\",\n",

I am so happy I no longer have to spend more to stock these coffees. My house is never out of the Raspberry Chocolate truffle and the Spicy Mayan. They have the best and most unique flavors.

Now: I think I do! :-)<br /><br />I\\'ve tried <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E50TSS\">International Coffee</a> type products, which are powdered drink mixes and not truly instant coffee, and I was never very impressed. Eventually, I learned (and you\\'ll laugh at me for not knowing this) that instant coffee is not a \"mix\" like hot chocolate but actually coffee beans treated differently in their production from coffee beans intended to be brewed. The bean is roasted as usual, then crushed (rather than cut as for brewing beans) in preparation for creating a coffee \"concentrate\" that will then be either freeze dried or spray dried. This product (as explained on the Nescafe website) is Robusta and Arabica beans, freeze dried, a method which may or may not be the top choice for connoisseurs of instant coffee, but being new to instant coffee I don\\'t yet appreciate the difference.<br /><br />I do know that the product in these single-serving sticks is the same product that was sold in canisters, before. This is just a new format for their current product, not a new product. And wow, for the sheer pleasure and convenience, it\\'s a decent cup of coffee! It can\\'t be mistaken for richly brewed coffee from a restaurant or from your home coffee machine, not even if you douse it with cream, but instead I compare it to \"office\" coffee, or \\'cafe au cube farm\\', which it definitely matches in taste and quality. Easy, quick, mellow. Great idea when I\\'m the only soul who wants a cup of coffee and can\\'t bear to brew just one or two lonely cups.<br /><br />The big disadvantage of instant coffee, as far as I\\'m concerned, is that a serving of this product has only abut 65mg of caffeine compared to 45-180mg of caffeine in a brewed cup of coffee (we\\'re talking in the upper end the way I brew mine!). I want my caffeine! The flavored versions of this product have even less caffeine per serving (at 25-30mg) although I couldn\\'t tell you why. (This information, by the way, comes from the Nescafe website FAQ.) The other disadvantage, I suppose, is that the whole house doesn\\'t fill with the sound and fragrance of brewing coffee when I choose to go instant.

I could understand at a business where you wouldn't want people tampering with it, but the pump leaves a  lot of creamer left in the bottom yet.

Since the coffee I purchased was just being put onto the grocer\\'s shelf, I know it was fresh and had not lost scent or flavor due to aging.  In an attempt to be sure my dissatisfaction was not due to drinking my coffee black with sweetner only, I added cream to the cup.  This did nothing to enhance or elevate the intensity of the caramel flavor.  Because the coffee does have a mild caramel tone, it actually has a bit of a burnt taste.<br /><br />I am less than pleased with Starbucks Natural Fusions Caramel Flavored coffee and have rated it as an average brew.  If you are interested in trying this coffee, visit the manufacturer\\'s and put the word \"fusions\" in the search box.  You will be able to print two coupons for $1.50 off a bag of this coffee so that you can decide for yourself whether Starbucks has produced a brew that meets its usual quality standards.',\n",

It's nowhere close to the full rich bold flavor and smell (some would say burned but I like it) of these two (and some other local coffeehouses where they roast their own beans).<br /><br />To me, Folgers-type coffees have a thin bitter aftertaste. Eight O'Clock has a bit of that though not bad. However, the beans don't look freshly roasted and don't have a strong aroma when first opening the bag. They look only slightly oily and light brown. Not the dark oily look of fresh Starbucks or Peets beans. I doubled the amount of coffee I usually use to brew and the flavor isn't bad, just not rich and strong.<br /><br />** Update 4/20/10 ** I tried mixing these coffee beans with Starbucks beans. The resulting coffee is a big improvement over Eight O'Clock alone and slightly mellows the Starbucks.<br /><br />** Update 7/2/10 ** I just tried the Italian Dark Roast and found it slightly better, with darker and more oily beans. Perhaps this is due to all four bags being properly vacuum sealed, unlike the French Roast batch I received.\",\n",

       " 'I bought the Dolce Gusto machine in 2008, and have been an avid fan of the machine and the capsules ever since.<br />While I do have a couple pointers (not quite complaints, but advice to make your Dolce Gusto experience better) that pertain to the machine itself -- and thus the final coffee product -- I feel the capsules themselves are not at fault for any of the machine\\'s problems.<br />After many days of getting used to the machine, I\\'ve found that loosely following the recommended milliliter measurements  on the boxes is a good start, and from there it\\'s up to you. Personally, I do just the recommended amount of milk and then pour the espresso until I see the tiniest hint of transparency in the flow. From there I wait anywhere from half a minute to a few minutes (the longer you wait, the more espresso left in the capsule makes it\\'s way to the bottom ready to get the last flush of hot water...but at the same time, the more the foam melts into the coffee), depending on what other busy morning activities I\\'ve gotten myself into while preparing the drink, and then push another few seconds worth of espresso out of the capsule. Does this make a world of difference in strength? I doubt it...but it gives me just that much darker of a drink and it makes me feel like I\\'m getting the most bang for my buck.<br />Ofcourse, the fact that I can get that much more espresso out of the capsule by waiting a bit isn\\'t necessarily all the capsule\\'s fault, but it is truly my only caveat (I also wonder if it\\'s possible to make recyclable capsules...). Either way, unless I\\'ve really overdone the amounts of milk or espresso (or haven\\'t gotten back to the machine in time to turn it off), getting a \\'watered-down\\' cappuccino is not possible and, in my opinion, purely an \\'operator problem\\' (see tip above).<br />Also something to note: a generally accepted typical single shot of espresso is made up of 8g of ground coffee and the final product shouldn\\'t be any more than 35mL. The instructions on the package tell you to pour about 40mL (and there is exactly 8g of espresso in the capsule). In other words, if you overdo the espresso capsule, you\\'ll be getting a noticeably watered down espresso (as for the whole cappuccino, I usually can\\'t tell if I\\'ve overdone it a touch).<br />Guests have always commented on the excellent look (use clear glasses for quite the show), feel, and taste of the foam and milk. I have to agree that compared to using other capsule-based machines where one has to purchase an extra milk-frother (and deal with the clean-up, supplies, etc), this system easily produces a comparable (at least) milk and foam experience, with very little hassle (if any).<br /><br />When it comes to flavors, there\\'s been a long-standing tie between Cappuccino and the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FI0O\">Latte Macchiato</a> in my household. We tend to always have a supply of Cappuccino around with the occasional box of Macchiatto every month or two. Cappuccino is definitely a favorite. Top notch. Never had a problem with a bad after-taste, or at least nothing but the great taste of good espresso.<br />For those who like to know where their coffee comes from: the milk is from France and the coffee capsules are from England (although the actual 100% ground and roasted arabica beans themselves, I don\\'t know). Also, there\\'s 8g of ground coffee in the espresso capsules (the Latte Macchiato has less -- in fact, the Macchiato box recommends 50mL of espresso for a capsule that contains 6.5g...in other words, the amount of espresso that you\\'d find in a fairly small single shot with the amount of water reserved for a small double shot...perhaps one of the reasons I tend to prefer the Cappuccino).<br /><br />And ofcourse, buying the boxes from Amazon.com with the subscribe and save is the most inexpensive option I\\'ve found.<br />Also, make sure to sign-up online at Dolce Gusto\\'s website for the award points you get with every box. With a box of three from Amazon (through subscribe and save), AND factoring in the 10 award points you get with every box (with which you can redeem Amazon gift cards), the price per box drops to a little over 7 dollars (compared to ~9 dollars a box at Sur la Table and other retailers).<br />And since I\\'m a money-saving statistics addict, I\\'m especially happy about the fact that the online rewards program keeps track of all the points you\\'ve ever recorded (thus telling me how many boxes I\\'ve ever purchased). This helps me calc. how much money I\\'ve saved in total in comparison to, say, Starbucks.<br />All in all, if you\\'re not quite willing to shell out major bucks for a real espresso machine, and have limited counter-space to begin with, the Dolce Gusto machine is an easy choice (they just released new and improved versions, too). **And, as of early October \\'10, they\\'ve revamped their boxes, giving them a classier, more matte-like finish (along with a recycle symbol on the bottom) and a cleaner look in terms of pictures and text. Great improvement to the design, and a fun, refreshing face-lift.**<br /><br />In terms of capsules, the Cappuccino is a solid choice -- a staple in my cabinet.',\n",

These coffees are a great combination of flavor and a medium bodied coffee. I have tried five of their flavors and all of them taste exactly like what they are supposed to taste like. The 5 I have tried are the raspberry truffle of course and Creme Caramel (tastes like those little square caramels you see at Halloween), Spicy Mayan ( My favorite chocolate and cinnamon mix), pecan praline and creme brulee. I am so happy I no longer have to spend more to stock these coffees. My house is never out of the Raspberry Chocolate truffle and the Spicy Mayan. They have the best and most unique flavors.

Coffee snobs may turn up their noses at instant coffee; and it's true that nothing beats a well-brewed cup of freshly made java.  But sometimes speed is of the essence and all you really need is a smooth, solid mug.  Of all the instant coffees I've tried, this one is the best.<br /><br />The coffee itself has a very nice, rich flavor.  It is instant coffee, so don't be expecting the greatest cup of Joe, but compared to other instant coffee brands Taster's Choice is by far the most appealing.  I take mine with a little bit of milk or half and half (whatever I've got in the fridge) because I tend to find the coffee a little bit too bitter when it's black.<br /><br />One change that I've noticed and disliked in the last few years has nothing to do with the coffee crystals but is in the container.  For years, this coffee was sold in a nicely shaped glass jar with a solid metal lid sealing in the flavor.  Nowadays Nescaf&eacute; distributes their coffee in a tall plastic container.  My objection to the change is not based on aesthetics (although the look and feel of the original is far preferable to the modern plastic abomination), but rather how fresh the product stays.<br /><br />In the glass container, I could have the coffee crystals sitting around for months and they would be just the same as they were when the jar was new.  But with the plastic container, I find that it simply doesn't do as good a job as the glass for keeping the crystals dry and fresh.  Very often, as the weeks and months go by, the crystals start getting damp and clumping together forcing me to break up large chunks of coffee crystal lumps, something which never occurred in the glass container.<br /><br />To solve this problem, I ended up finding an old Nescaf&eacute; Taster's Choice glass jar and simply reusing that one over and over again.  Every time I need a refill, I wash out the old jar and fill it with the coffee I bought in the plastic container.  I'd like to think that Nescaf&eacute; is still producing the glass jars somewhere, but if so I've haven't found them.<br /><br />For instant coffee that actually tastes like coffee, I've been happy with Taster's Choice.  It's not what I turn to when I want an absolutely fantastic tasting, 100% pure, guaranteed to knock your socks off and touch the face of God cup of coffee, but it is what I choose when I want something right now.\",\n",

I'm lazy and this defeats the purpose of a Keurig brewer in the first place.<br /><br />There is a reason that Pike Place put Starbucks on the map nearly 40 years ago.  It is THE perfect medium blend.  There is plenty of flavor for dark coffee drinkers to enjoy, and is not too rich or 'burnt' for light coffee drinkers.

       " 'I recently purchased a Vienna Superautomatica as an inexpensive second espresso maker. The first thing I noticed is that it is Italian made like many of the great espresso machines. The body of the Vienna is \"graphite\" plastic, and while it does not feel first class, it somehow has a pretty sturdy feel to it. I also like that the footprint is pretty small thus taking up little counter space.<br /><br />I opened the manual, which is not particularly clear, but need not be on account of very simple operation. The Vienna has three buttons--on/off, coffee, and steam. It also has a steamer control knob and a water volume knob.<br /><br />I turned on the machine after filling the coffee and water tanks. The buttons feel Italian--you\\'ll know what I mean if you\\'ve owned an Alfa Romeo. They are a bit clunky next to my old Capresso C1000, but they work well (for now).<br /><br />The Vienna takes a couple of minutes to warm up--I don\\'t mind this for reasons I\\'ll reveal in a minute. The coffee spout is adjustable up and down to accommodate a large variety of cups and mugs. Once it\\'s ready, the coffee light stops blinking. I push the button and it begins to grind the coffee. The noise level of the machine is louder than my Capresso, but not too bad. You might wake up the house with it in the morning, but my child stayed asleep. Once the coffee finishes the grind, the Vienna immediately begins making espresso.<br /><br />My first impression was that I saw a lot more steam coming from the coffee than my Capresso. I am hopeful. The coffee also looked a bit thicker than the Capresso. After the Vienna finished I observed the cup: nice crema, plenty hot, and smells like the genuine article. I gave it a taste--wow, step aside Capresso, this espresso is richer, hotter, and a lot closer to coffee bar espresso. Next I took a sip. Ah yes, the cup holds rich chocolatey espresso. If you are sort of a coffee snob, you\\'ll like what you taste. The coffee is much richer than the Capresso, which I attribute to hotter water and fuller extraction.<br /><br />I\\'m sure that the Vienna will not make good enough espresso for some folks, but to me, it still tastes better than Starbucks. It was more than $100 cheaper than my Capresso and frankly makes better espresso. I cannot yet speak to the durability of the machine, but the Vienna is now my favorite inexpensive espresso maker.',\n",
       " 'Vienna Plus is my third fully automatic machine. I loved my first, Saeco original Vienna, hated the second, Saeco Incanto classic. The original Vienna worked for 3 years every day, making consistently good espresso before the pump gave. I should have paid for repair, but I succumbed to that stainless steel twinkle and went for Saeco Incanto classic. More expensive for sure. Worse, better said inconsistent, coffee quality, constant small problems relating to built quality concerning the brew group, the grinder and the steamer wand. After a year of irritation a pump seal has failed while making espresso, nothing like a small explosion in the kitchen in the morning, I tell ya. Well, gone back to the trusted Vienna, now with  the plus in the name. Good old days are here again .... Compared to previous- it is a lot quieter, when both grinding and steaming, it is also a lot quicker to warm up then before, steam is ready a mere 15 seconds after pushing the button. Espresso has a beautiful rich crema right out of the box, I didn\\'t have to experiment with grind setting at all. The steaming wand (Panarello) has been redesigned and is now foolproof maker of perfect frothed foam. For the newbie I would like to add that I spent a lot of effort to find the right roast - tasted more than a few before I settled on one (Peerless Coffee Espressp Perfection) that I buy now in 5 lb. bags and keep in the freezer. I should for fairness add that I never want any other coffee through the machine like some decaf or flavored stuff, so I don\\'t miss the alternate ground coffee option that Incanto had. My priority has always been flavor and consistency and that the Vienna Plus delivers. My friends drive miles to \"see me\" and, by the way, get a cup of espresso, praising each one as \"this is the best espresso in the world\".  If that is what you desire, don\\'t get mesmerized by stainless steel shine or computerized display magic and save yourself some money by getting this machine. You won\\'t regret it.

       " \"We owned a Saeco Vienna Deluxe since January 2004, but decided to purchase a newer model in September 2010.  The Vienna Deluxe served us well for six and a half years, but was beginning to show its age.  The Saeco Vienna Plus is the updated version of the Vienna Deluxe.<br /><br />Saeco's Vienna Plus super-automatic espresso machine is simple to use.  Add up to 57 oz filtered cold water to the reservoir, up to 12 oz beans in the hopper, and then turn the machine on.  While warming up, adjust the volume dial for a 1 to 6 oz pour. Once ready, press the coffee button once to make an espresso or twice for a double shot or two espressos.  If a latte is desired, press the steam button after the espresso has finished brewing and turn the steam knob to activate the pannarello to steam the milk.  Turning the steam knob without pressing the steam button will produce hot water from the pannarello instead.<br /><br />The perfect espresso may require adjusting a couple dials in the hopper. A strength dial controls the amount of grounds used per cup.  A second knob controls the grind's coarseness. These settings are typically adjusted once then left alone if you chose to alter the factory setting.  The factory settings work well for us, so we didn't adjust these controls.<br /><br />Maintaining and cleaning the Vienna Plus espresso machine is just as simple.  Cleaning consists of a weekly (or after every 15 pucks) wipe down of the machine, rinsing off the brew group with warm water, and emptying and washing the drip tray and grounds drawer.  Incidentally, the used coffee grounds are beneficial to soil when spread out in the gardens or lawn.  Once every three months, running descaler through the boiler keeps the inner workings in good condition.<br /><br />A common complaint about Saeco Vienna espresso machines is the outer plastic cabinet.  The durable plastic cabinet was not a problem for us on the old machine, as it didn't chip, crack, or break with normal use.  The Veinna Plus uses the same plastic material for the outer cabinet, and is probably used to keep the cost down.  The internal workings, like the stainless steel boiler, are hidden from view and use more expensive materials.<br /><br />Another complaint I've read about is the grinder getting clogged.  Our local coffee shop advised us not to purchase oily beans like many flavored coffees.  If you enjoy flavored coffee, add syrup to the cup instead.  Choosing the right beans, and regular cleanings has kept us from experiencing this problem.<br /><br />Compared to the Vienna Deluxe, the Vienna Plus super-automatic espresso machine has an updated look, but operates the same and is similarly sized.  However the Vienna plus is quieter, and the pannarello has been improved for easier and more consistent frothing.<br /><br />Ultimately, the Vienna Plus super-automatic espresso machine is simple to use and maintain; plus produces a great tasting espresso and Americano.  If you're looking for a fully automatic espresso machine, this one is definitely worth considering.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Fresh quality coffee made at the press of a button<br />Makes consistently great tasting coffee/espresso<br />Simple to use<br />Easy to clean/maintain<br />Biodegradable waste is great for the garden<br /><br />CONS:<br />This espresso machine is sure to spoil its owners<br />Cannot handle large quantities quickly\",\n",
       " 'We had a Saeco Vienna Deluxe for several years.  The machine finally died on us.  In searching for a new machine, I saw the Saeco Vienna Plus and knew this would be the next machine.  It is very similar to our previous model.  It is much cheaper than when we had purchased our first unit.  I feel there is value in what we are getting.  It saves us a fortune from having to run to the more expensive coffee shop chains to pick up a mocha when it can easily made at home.  At the touch of a button or two, the coffee is ready to go.  The ease of use is amazing.  Clean up is easy.  I would definitely recommend this machine for those who want to be able to make espresso with ease.',\n",
       " 'In about 3 minutes, this machine grinds the beans (no separate appliance needed for that!),<br />tamps down the grind (no separate tool for that!)and produces foamy hot espresso. Plus, the<br />steam is strong enough to foam up 2% milk!  Everything cleans up in a flash...second cup, no<br />long wait.  If you like strong coffee set the grind about four clicks from the maximum setting<br />and the setting for amount of coffee for each use at the max.  Lovely.',\n",
       " \"Easy to use machine that works well making espresso or just an single cup of coffee. The only complaint I have is if you are using a large cup for regular coffee you have to angle putting in and removing the cup since the bottom of the drip spouts are not high enough even when adjusting the pull-down or push-up spout that is provided. This is a well priced unit for what it provides you. You can adjust the grind of the beans but it comes manufacturer set for a medium grind. It comes with lights that once turn solid green let you know that you are ready to use whatever function you choose and dial for adjusting espresso to a full cup of coffee is clearly marked and easy to read. Steam is provided when pressing the 3rd button on - when it is off you get very hot water dispensed. The area for grinding the beans handles a lot so if you like switching types of coffee then you have to keep only the amount for what you are using in the grinder since there is no way of easily switching coffee beans once the container is full. Overall I would recommend it for anyone who likes to prepare their own coffee because of it's price and ease of use.\",\n",
       " 'We\\'ve owned this machine for 11 months and therefore can provide a longer term review. Please note we bought this on sale at Costco for $350, but it\\'s worth more.<br /><br />Ease of use: while this is a superautomatic, don\\'t assume you can brew a perfect cup of coffee/espresso with no experimentation. This isn\\'t a Keurig. The advantage of superautomatics is ease of use and consistency once you\\'ve optimized brewing. Similar to semi-automatic espresso machines, you do have control over your final product. You still have to find the correct coffee grind setting/amount, etc. You still need to aim for a 25 second extraction time. Once you do, though, you\\'ll have great results each and every time.<br /><br />Maintenance: this machine requires minimal daily maintenance. The water reservoir is small so have a water pitcher handy. Fresh water is ideal for brewing anyway. Ditto for the coffee bean hopper. But again, who wants beans sitting out going stale? Weekly maintenance involves cleaning the brew group. This is easy. Every 2-3 months the machine should be descaled. This does require time.<br /><br />Taste: we are big fans of french press coffee for its richness of flavor. This is the first \"coffee machine\" that can best a french press with less effort, less cleanup, and more consistency. The coffee is makes is excellent (termed coffee crema as it retains crema on the top), and I find it difficult to drink coffee outside the home now. The espresso it makes is equally excellent. It surpasses Starbuck\\'s with ease, and is equivalent to espresso you\\'ll get from most cafes. However, it\\'s not as good as you\\'ll find at an Intelligentsia, or similar quality cafe. But it\\'s quite consistent. Don\\'t forget that beans are an important variable. Try black cat espresso from Intelligentsia, preferably roasted only a few weeks in advance.<br /><br />Milk frothing: anywhere from adequate to very good. Definitely depends on type of milk and skill. I can usually make quite good foam, but it can\\'t do true microfoam.<br /><br />Quality/workmanship: plastic outer casing and plastic brew group. Looks flimsy, but has held up over the past year. It makes a strange high pitched noise while brewing, probably from the where the coffee comes out (likely just our machine) but we\\'ve otherwise not had problems. Also, it\\'s the same brew group used in their other machines, so taste should be equivalent to more expensive machines.<br /><br />Features: this is bare bone. No timer, no computer presets. But this is also why the price point is so good. You get a great espresso maker and decent grinder for a relatively low price.<br /><br />Speed: warms up from turn on in 2-3 minutes. Then takes (with grinding) from about 35-40 sec for espresso to a bit longer for a cup of coffee (can make a full american sized cup). Warm up for steaming is quick. To then brew after steaming takes only about 15 seconds as long as you purge hot water. So getting to know how the machine works is important.<br /><br />Summary: fantastic consistent coffee, excellent espresso with nice crema, and very good steaming at a great price. A great barista with a high end grinder and high end semi-automatic can probably make better espresso, but this is great for the rest of us. And early in the morning this is what you want.',\n",
       " 'I had an \"El Cheapo\" espresso/coffee combo from Krups that worked well for many years until the pump gave out. I scoured the Internet for a worthy machine that I could depend on and purchased one of the Breville espresso makers. I returned it the next day. It made terrible weak coffee. Then I happened to be wandering through Wal Mart and saw a $70.00 Hamilton Beach machine. It made great coffee with crema and it was strong enough to froth milk. The next morning, I went to make a cup and the machine had leaked all over my countertop! I was lucky to have unplugged it the night before or else there could have been an electrical fire. Back to Wal Mart it went.<br /><br />Neither of these machines were automatic and I had to grind my own coffee beans (which I prefer, even with my regular coffee). I saw the Saeco, read the reviews and said, \"If this doesn\\'t perform, I\\'m not making espresso ever again.\" When it arrived, I followed the \"Quick Start\" instructions and filled the hopper with my French roast beans. I crossed my fingers and pressed the \"On\" button. When all the lights were ready, I pressed the \"Coffee\" button. In about 15 seconds I had one of the most beautiful cups of espresso complete with a heady froth of crema!<br /><br />I was so impressed, I made another cup. Ahhh, heavenly. Of course, I couldn\\'t sleep that night - the caffeine replaced the blood in my veins.<br /><br />The milk steamer wand is also mighty powerful. It froths milk just like a commercial machine. Something my Krups didn\\'t do very well.<br /><br />In summation, this is a wonderful machine in its price range. I highly recommend it. Oh, and by the way, the clown who gave it a 1-star review? That\\'s a hoax. There is no such wording on the box or in the manual.',\n",

It\\'s kind of like mint in that way, but not mint-flavored.

Don\\'t let the words dark and extra bold scare you off - this coffee is rich, smooth and in many ways mellow.

This coffee brewed up strong, but had a bit of an empty, bitter finish.  The caffeine content is acceptable.  The package could have been treated a little better during shipping as there were lots of dents, crushed corners and sides, and evidence of bending on the sides of the k-cups.  None of the cups have thus far shown a broken seal though.<br /><br />Overall this is an acceptable extra bold style k-cup, but there are better options out there.  My favorites have been the Newman's Own and the Sumatran Reserve.  I haven't tried the Black Diamond K-cups as they are a bit pricey right now also.  I'll probably end up using a coupon and buying my preferred flavors in a brick and mortar store nearby for a better price, or ordering some Coffee People 50-count extra bold flavors.  Their boxes have had pretty stable pricing for the past 6 months or so.<br /><br />If you are out of options, this is a cheaper substitute for a pricier extra bold flavor.  I wish Amazon could sort out their supply issues and keep K-cup prices a little more stable.  Lastly, I wouldn't buy these again if I had other similar priced options.<br /><br />TL;DR - These are okay, but go for other extra bold flavors if they are priced about the same.\",\n",

Nespresso has a very tight grip on the distribution of their capsules, but a slight design change in these allows them to work with the Nespresso machines while still not infringing on their copyright.  Note: There are alternatives to this product which are re-usable called Nex-pod, and another referred to only as \"3 Brown or 3 Black\"  or coffeeduck <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ZEGLH2\">CoffeeDuck Refillable Coffee Capsules For Nespresso - 3 Pods - Thes Espresso Cups fit all Nespresso machines from after October 2010 - Please make sure you have the correct machine before purchasing</a>..... I haven\\'t tried these myself, they are a bit more expensive and from what I\\'ve read in other reviews and have seen on YouTube, they didn\\'t just didn\\'t seem to be the best choice for me; you may want to go online and look at the Amazon reviews of these products to judge yourself.  Also, it looks like the brown ones (which are out of stock) are the ones for Nespresso machines made prior to October 2010; the black ones (still available here) are for machines after 2010 (I have the old original C190 Concept machine (model c190) from 2001). Just as an aside, I\\'ve also seen videos of people simply re-using a used Nespresso pod  and re-sealing the foil piece with a new piece of aluminum foil (I tried this once and the results were really crappy and watery, and coffee grounds ended up in my machine).<br /><br />Anyway, back to Ne-Cap.....I fill it with my own espresso grind (illy or Lavazza) and I\\'ve got to say that the coffee was good and had a decent crema.  They\\'re pretty easy to use as well, although you might need to experiment a bit with the coffee, grind and amount you put into the capsule to ensure you get a nice rich cup of coffee.  Take out a new capsule, using your pod as the \"scoop\", scoop it to the very top and then simply wipe off the excess so it is filled to the top but not overflowing the rim, then very carefully peel off the paper ring from the top of the cup (uncovering the sticky ring on the top of the cap) and then place the pre-cut aluminum cap on top of the capsule to seal in the coffee (note: you need to be somewhat careful when you\\'re peeling off the paper from the cup to expose the sticky seal or else you\\'ll also remove the sticky seal which is supposed to stay on the cup).  Although the sticky seal for these capsules is not the same as the Nespresso air tight seal (which I think is only done to keep their packaged coffee fresh), the seal is good enough to perform the job and prevent coffee from exploding outside the capsules.  I know their video shows them tamping down the coffee pods as they fill them, but for me, no tamping works best (and it\\'s simpler).<br /><br />After experimenting a bit, I noticed that if you want the richer coffee and thick crema, you should stick with a darker roasted, robusta beans, finely ground (espresso or fine grind...check out <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0D8\">Lavazza Crema e Gusto Ground Coffee, Italian , 8.8-Ounce Bricks (Pack of 4)</a> which is primarily robusta and is on sale with subscribe and save).  And when tamping down on the coffee, don\\'t pack it in too much before attaching the foil top or else you just get a little dribble of coffee coming out (and in all honesty, I\\'ve been using these capsules for some time, but every once in awhile, this still happens to me. The drink is fine, it just takes awhile longer to fill the cup).  Along with the illy brand of coffee,  Cafe Pico, Cafe Bustelo, Lavazza Crema and Pilon also do a very good job in these capsules. If you want to see how much coffee Nespresso uses in their capsules, you can also open up a new Nespresso capsule and see what the grind looks like and the amount of coffee they use so you get an idea. I\\'m too cheap to do that ;-)<br /><br />I wouldn\\'t recommend making these cups too far in advance (since you don\\'t have an airtight seal once you make the cup), but instead make them when you\\'re ready to use them that day.  Although this may seem a bit of work if you\\'re in a rush (and remember, you do have to buy your own coffee), it is sort of fun to experiment with the different blends (you can use any full or half decaff coffee for those last minute guests that want espresso without all the caffeine or you can experiment and add flavorings like vanilla, spices etc.).',\n",

       " \"These do not look like regular K-cups. And perhaps they won't keep as long because the bottom looks like it's made of rounded cloth, kind of like a tea bag. But they fit Keurig machines just fine, are less expensive, and most importantly I think this coffee tastes better than the coffee in plastic K-cups. I actually prefer the fact that the bottom is not made of plastic. I never liked the idea that my hot coffee was being strained through a plastic cup. In fact, I just ordered more.\",\n",
       " 'Don\\'t be alarmed when you receive these and they don\\'t look like a standard K-cup. These are not K-cups, but dowill fit in your machine. I thought I had ordered the wrong product at first. These simply have a plastic ring at the top so that they\\'ll fit in your K-cup holder and the rest of it is like a standard coffee filter. I\\'ve only tried Fog Chaser (ordered all 3 flavors) and was surprised that I liked the coffee. However, because it\\'s using a filter rather than the K-cup technology, it does leave a sediment in the bottom of your cup. I find this also happens when using the My K-Cup filter with whatever brand of coffee I use.<br /><br />You will need to store the \"k-cups\" in a ziploc to keep them fresh. The 36-count come packaged in 3 plastic bags of 12 each. This is nice so that you only have to open up one 12 pack at a time so the others can stay fresh.<br /><br />I\\'m mostly neutral, but lean more toward \"would buy again\".',\n",
       " 'This coffee is great in my Keurig and alot more reasonably priced here at Amazon. Shipping was fast and worry free. I really like the fact that this comes packed in 10 individual packs of 8 k-cups each. The reason for this is that these k-cups are different in their construction. Each one is plastic at the top but filter for the lower 3/4 of the k-cup. At first I thought..oh no..I see a big mess coming, but to my great surprise, everything went perfectly. I like this design for two reasons, one..they are made with green practices in every way possible, and..two..they brew alot faster than the regular k-cups. The taste is great, bold and deep mellow flavor, this is my new coffee for sure.',\n",
       " 'I am the buyer for a 20-person department.  The folks who like a bold strong coffee love this one.  I like it as well, but I use the 10-oz setting when I make it instead of my typical 8-oz.<br />\"Fogchaser\" sums it up pretty well.  This will clear your head and get you ready to roll.<br />I also love that there is less packaging.  I must admit to a bit of guilt over the whole K-Cup disposal situation.  (I make people use china coffee cups and am happy to wash them!)  These do not have the plastic outer cup.  I keep them in a plastic container with a sealed lid instead of in the K-Cup carousel to keep them fresher.  But I gotta tell you--opening that lid yields the most wonderful coffee aroma.',\n",
       " \"Finally, a robust, bold coffee from a Keurig coffee pot.  I had trouble finding one that wasn't wimpy, but this is it!  And it is cheaper than any other.  As an added benefit, the k-cups are constructed in a much more earth-friendly way, no plastic cup.  Why don't other brands go this route?\",\n",
       " 'I was really lured in by the price and eco-friendly \"pod\" cup. I had read the good and bad reviews and decided it was worth trying the Fog Chaser. Well, I loved it! My cup was as bold and rich as traditional plastic K-cups and better than the reuseable cups (My K-cup, Ekobrew). This will be a mainstay in my coffee selection due to the flavor and affordability. I highly recommend trying it.<br /><br />Hopefully, someone can comment on whether these will work for the new Keurig Vue machine.',\n",
       " \"I rarely rate things 5 stars, this coffee deserves the top rating. It is incredibly good, I don't think I want a cup of coffee and then I remember these are in the carousel for my Keurig machine, I change my mind in a heartbeat. It's like having a box of your favorite snack in the cupboard and trying to resist eating it, but you know it's there and you keep thinking about it.<br /><br />The flavor of this San Fransisco Bay coffee is rich, complex, and delicious. I can't think of a cup of coffee that I've bought anywhere that can beat the bold, rich flavor of this brand. It's like drinking a glass of fine wine. My favorite k-cup previous to this was Tulley's Kona Blend.<br /><br />The packaging of the individual coffee pod threw me off because when I opened the plastic bag with the pods in it, a very strong aroma of coffee filled the air. I wondered if the paper filter bottoms of the pods wouldn't let the coffee get stale, so I put them in a ziplock baggie. Time will tell I guess if the paper filter will allow the coffee to get stale or not. On the other hand I liked that there was a more green solution to the regular plastic coffee pod holder. I'm torn on this, I 'think' I'd rather have the pods be the more usual plastic in order to preserve freshness, but time will tell. I doubt any of the pods I have will have time to ever get stale however, because I'm drinking them all the time.\",\n",

If you are using a Senseo coffee machine, you probably should moisten the Java pod and smooth it before attempting to latch the lid. Otherwise, you risk breaking the latching mechanism. The resulting decaf coffee is not bad and seems to this reviewer to have a richer taste than the Senseo decaf pods. The Melitta Java pods are not really designed for the Senseo machine and several other brands such as Halo, Fratello and Millstone work better in the Senseo machine.',\n",

I always reserve Kona for lazy weekend brunches or to serve with dessert after a lovely dinner.  <p>Aloha Island operates the only quality management program in Kona, so their coffees are certified as 100% Kona.  Which just means that you're guaranteed to get quality Kona coffee if you order from them. <p>Keep in mind that Aloha Island has three grades of Kona coffee that they sell - gold, platinum, and diamond (which is supposed to be their private reserve).

Well, after getting it home, I was pleasantly surprised on a couple notes.<br /><br />First, the coffee is delicious.  Good body, bright flavor.  Really nice cup of coffee. (I don\\'t use cream or sugar.)<br /><br />The second surprise is that the K-cups aren\\'t full cups. Plastic is only used for the rim to provide rigidity so the cup will hold up under the pressure of the brewer.  My guess us that they use about 66% less plastic - less waste, less mess for the landfill. Aside from the rim, there is the filter material, which seems to be a better filter than in the full plastic cups.<br /><br />Finally, I\\'ve used the Eco-Cups over the years and really liked them, because I could use my own coffee.  The only problem is that cleaning them is not easy.  I had tried the MyCaps so I could refill the original K-cups with my own coffee.  While they worked well, cleaning the cups was messy (hence switching to the Eco-Cups).  These cups work GREAT with the MyCaps, since they are so easy to clean out and not messy at all.  Instead of trying to rinse out the used coffee, I now just peel the foil, and push the used coffee into into a container so I can compost it.  Then, with a simple rinse, it\\'s ready to refill and pop on a MyCap and brew again.  What\\'s great is that the coffee, itself is excellent and you can reuse the filters over and over with your own coffee.  Now, I keep a box of this coffee around for when I don\\'t have time to do a refill, and refill when I want a little variety.  Best of both worlds.<br /><br />By the way, refilling them with the same grind-your-own, whole bean coffee also saves money (a lot of it).  You can do that by buying <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005RO5M1Q\">San Francisco Bay 100% Organic Coffee Rainforest Blend Whole Bean 3 Lbs</a> from Amazon. How can you go wrong?',\n",

They were just 3 thickish cellophane bags with 12 cups in each, which I thought was strange because when I ordered the Fogchaser, each pack of 12 was in a box and I was able to give one as a gift to my coffee buddy at work. As for the coffee getting stale as others are concerned about, well.....coffee doesn't last very long around here. 12 cups goes in much less than a week and I have not noticed any staleness by storing these in my upright Keurig carousel. That's probably because this particular carousel does not leave the bottoms of the cups exposed to air. I digress. I do recommend the Rainforest Blend -- it's a great cup of coffee at a really good price. And less packaging to boot.\",\n",
       " \"It's not often I leave a product review, but I'm very happy with the fresh ground taste of the coffee, and the environmentally friendly packing is a nice bonus.  Shipping was fast and I have a new favorite brand of coffee for my Keurig Brewer.\",\n",
       " \"This product is an interesting cross between a Keurig cup and a pod.  They work in my old B-70, but just from looking at it you can see that it contains less coffee than a typical k-cup.  As a result, it brews a decent cup of coffee on the lower setting, but it's weak as a grande.  That may work for you - at the current subscribe-n-save price it's cheap for a k-cup.<br /><br />The flavor is perfectly ok - I'm not a coffee purist, but I'd call it a dark blend more akin to Sumatran than Colombian, i.e. not so smooth.<br /><br />There is one thing I guess I should add - these things have a pod-type body, i.e. a filter-packet holding the coffee, instead of the k-cup's all-plastic body.  Typical pods come in individual sealed packets to preserve freshness, but all 12 k-pods in each SFBay box are in a single, non-resealable plastic envelope.  This means that once you've opened the envelope, you're losing freshness faster than usual.  Again I'm no purist, but this would lead to staler coffee if you're not brewing these in a hurry - or resealing them somehow?  The box offers no advice or directions.\",\n",
       " \"This alternative to the traditional plastic K-Cup caught my eye immediately because of the price.  I have been buying the basic Ks from Amazon for years, always pretty much around the same price, and have been eager to see the drop in prices once Green Mountain's patent expires on the technology.  This company found a unique way of getting around the patent with these filter-exposed cups.  To our benefit, this brand sells more for less, and that to me was worth the try. I chose the Breakfast Blend because I normally drink the Coffee People Donut Shop, which I too love, and I thought this would be the closest match.  This turned out to be true, both are smooth and not too strong or robust.  Both have good flavor without being over the top.  As for the style of the cup, as all others have said, it does not have the plastic canister look, but rather just the filter, which I personally like.  Unlike the traditional cups, you get a whiff of coffee just before you put it in the machine, which is a nice tease.  I just filled up a Ziplock bag to keep them fresh and it's easy enough.  I'm also keeping the spent cups to use for fertilizer, just cut off the top, dry out the grounds and pour them around your garden.<br /><br />Overall I'd highly recommend this, the price is great and the coffee is very good.  If you are a Coffee People Donut Shop fan like me, you'll enjoy this Breakfast Blend.  If you prefer jet fuel, this will not appeal to you.\",\n",
       " \"... if you use cardamom a lot. The powdered cardamom is a waste of money; once the jar is opened, it loses 90% of its flavor within a day or two. The whole pods are troublesome to peel, though if you use cardamom less than once a week, the pods retain the maximum flavor and justify the trouble. But if you use cardamom in the quantities of either a Swedish baker or an Indian curry-maker -- or, like me, both -- a 16-ounce bag of decorticated seeds will 'get you through'.<br /><br />You can grind these seeds in a mortar, and it's kinda fun to do so, but I'd recommend a small cheap electric coffee mill dedicated to cardamom only. It won't clog and it won't need washing.<br /><br />If you buy the whole green cardamom pods, you can use the pods in coffee, putting the pods in the filter cone with the grounds. Assuming, of course, that you like the taste. It seems to be growing in popularity in the USA and Canada; lots of creameries are now offering cardamom ice cream. Yum!\",\n",
       " 'This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can\\'t find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you\\'re curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it\\'s compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I\\'d like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they\\'re reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it\\'s very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it\\'s capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn\\'t be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own \"stand\" in order to fill it properly.',\n",
       " 'Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don\\'t love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the \"old fashion way\" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don\\'t feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won\\'t be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew!',\n",
       " 'When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn\\'t much better. Third time\\'s a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you\\'ll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16\" thick, 5/32\" inside diameter, and 3/8\" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493.',\n",
       " \"At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.  Good coarse grind, check.  No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.  I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail!<br />We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean.  We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.<br />Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug.\",\n",
       " \"Just got the Ekobrew today and tried it out. I have been a Solofill fan since they came out but the Ekobrew design seems to beat the Solofill. First off, the flat bottom makes it easy to fill. I usually run two cycles for a larger cup of coffee. With the Ekobrew the lid stays shut and doesn't leak water at the top. I was surprised how easily the grounds came out and just a quick rinse and it was ready to go again. Seems to be the best choice around for avoiding the high cost of K cups.\",\n",
       " \"WOW - we got our keurig as a gift and with the gift was a big box of the k-cups with all the eh, average tasting coffees...but once those ran out we would never be the people to spend that much money on coffee every month. so we have been using the solofil for about 8 months. we hated it and because of it, hated the keurig. the coffee we buy (the strongest roast from starbucks) was always watery and the solofil would leak all the time and it was such a pain to clean. but we put up with it. ENTER the ekobrew! omg this thing is amazing. i don't know what makes it so much different and i don't care -i just care that we get an amazing cup of coffee from our machine now!  SUCH  a difference. we used to use the solofil twice for one cup of coffee - we would make two of the smallest cups to make it as strong as possible. not anymore!! highly recommend! buying 2 more!\",\n",
       " \"My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys.\",\n",
       " \"With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time.  Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!\",\n",

I\\'ve been on a fitness regimen for a couple years and became interested in cinnamon because of Tim Ferriss\\' book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030746363X\">The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman</a>.<br /><br />On pages 144-145 Tim recommends Saigon cinnamon, followed by Cassia *because* they contain the highest amount of \"coumarin\", a blood thinning drug that also affects blood sugar. This can be dangerous in high doses and Tim recommends taking no more than 1.5 teaspoons per day. Note that those types of cinnamon are regulated in Europe for the same reason.<br /><br />For three months I used <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SBI04A\">Saigon Cinnamon 7oz.</a>. I purchased this at a \"big box\" store for about $6, however it is no longer available locally. The taste is quite intense and *super* \"cinnamon-y\". I used a teaspoon in my coffee every day. I feel that it had a positive effect on my metabolism, energy and ability to maintain my weight. When that began to run out I looked for a new source.<br /><br />I read more (including reviews on Amazon) and wanted to try the Ceylon cinnamon (also called \"true cinnamon\"), i.e. the product sold here. Ceynon cinnamon has a minute amount of coumarin and is seen as entirely safe.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GKV8DQ\">Indus Organic Ceylon Cinnamon Powder Spice Pack, (1 lb)</a> was the best buy in terms of price and customer satisfaction. It cost about twice as much as the Saigon cinnamon I\\'ve been using but it is organic and Fair Trade Certified. Delivery was super fast.<br /><br />The product is definitely more subtle than the Saigon variety in both smell and taste. I prefer the intensity of the Saigon variety, but that\\'s a personal thing. This Ceylon variety has a bit of a \"piney\" scent and taste, especially in coffee. It\\'s sweetening effect in coffee is far less noticeable than the Saigon variety.<br /><br />This Ceylon variety is ground *extremely* fine -- it\\'s almost like talcum powder. Keep in mind that cinnamon is a wood-like substance and when you grind wood you get sawdust. In coffee this Ceylon variety is much less pleasant because it sinks to the bottom in greater quantities and it also feels scratchier on my throat. Compared to the Saigon I was using, there\\'s about twice as much residue left when I\\'m done drinking. All this may just be due to the fineness of the grind.<br /><br />I will be switching back to the Saigon variety for medical, taste and texture reasons.

Really...they're kcups, not bone china, why the need for 2 packages, carboard, plastic and another box?<br /><br />I like the fact that these kcups come in a single box, not as much waste.<br /><br />Anyway, my picky husband said that this coffee was surprisingly good.

I don\\'t make smaller cups to make it stronger, nor do I run extra water to make it weaker. I judge each k-cup in 9.25oz. It should also be noted that I use spring water exclusively in my machine; done for both taste and machine longevity. (The tap water where I live is brutal. Life span of a water heater is 5-8 years.)<br /><br />I tend to like full-bodied/full-flavored coffee (that doesn\\'t always mean \"strong\"). Therefore, I tend to like the dark roasts better, which is why I find Donut Shop just a bit lacking (but I like it enough that I still drink it).<br /><br />After trying the variety pack (and having since bought this item by itself as verified above), I can honestly say that by far my new favorite K-Cup is Jet Fuel (and I\\'ve tried at least 15-20 different varieties, not including flavored or decaf coffee). It has full flavor that is really good, but has no \"strong\" characteristics IMO (i.e. bitter, burnt, dense, etc.). When I took the first sip of Jet Fuel, I immediately thought, \"Wow, this is good coffee!\"<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like a full-bodied coffee that doesn\\'t have any bitterness or burnt characteristics, and is not too dense.',\n",

Don\\'t let the words dark and extra bold scare you off - this coffee is rich, smooth and in many ways mellow.

This coffee brewed up strong, but had a bit of an empty, bitter finish.  The caffeine content is acceptable.  The package could have been treated a little better during shipping as there were lots of dents, crushed corners and sides, and evidence of bending on the sides of the k-cups.  None of the cups have thus far shown a broken seal though.<br /><br />Overall this is an acceptable extra bold style k-cup, but there are better options out there.  My favorites have been the Newman's Own and the Sumatran Reserve.  I haven't tried the Black Diamond K-cups as they are a bit pricey right now also.  I'll probably end up using a coupon and buying my preferred flavors in a brick and mortar store nearby for a better price, or ordering some Coffee People 50-count extra bold flavors.  Their boxes have had pretty stable pricing for the past 6 months or so.<br /><br />If you are out of options, this is a cheaper substitute for a pricier extra bold flavor.  I wish Amazon could sort out their supply issues and keep K-cup prices a little more stable.  Lastly, I wouldn't buy these again if I had other similar priced options.<br /><br />TL;DR - These are okay, but go for other extra bold flavors if they are priced about the same.\",\n",

       " 'This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can\\'t find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you\\'re curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it\\'s compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I\\'d like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they\\'re reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it\\'s very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it\\'s capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn\\'t be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own \"stand\" in order to fill it properly.',\n",
       " 'Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don\\'t love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the \"old fashion way\" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don\\'t feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won\\'t be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I.

       " 'When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn\\'t much better. Third time\\'s a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you\\'ll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16\" thick, 5/32\" inside diameter, and 3/8\" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493.',\n",
       " \"At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.  Good coarse grind, check.  No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.  I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail!<br />We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean.  We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.<br />Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug.\",\n",
       " \"Just got the Ekobrew today and tried it out. I have been a Solofill fan since they came out but the Ekobrew design seems to beat the Solofill. First off, the flat bottom makes it easy to fill. I usually run two cycles for a larger cup of coffee. With the Ekobrew the lid stays shut and doesn't leak water at the top. I was surprised how easily the grounds came out and just a quick rinse and it was ready to go again. Seems to be the best choice around for avoiding the high cost of K cups.\",\n",

ENTER the ekobrew! omg this thing is amazing. i don't know what makes it so much different and i don't care -i just care that we get an amazing cup of coffee from our machine now!  SUCH  a difference. we used to use the solofil twice for one cup of coffee - we would make two of the smallest cups to make it as strong as possible. not anymore!! highly recommend! buying 2 more!\",\n",
       " \"My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys.\",\n",
       " \"With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time.  Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!\",\n",

Well, after getting it home, I was pleasantly surprised on a couple notes.<br /><br />First, the coffee is delicious.  Good body, bright flavor.  Really nice cup of coffee. (I don\\'t use cream or sugar.)<br /><br />The second surprise is that the K-cups aren\\'t full cups. Plastic is only used for the rim to provide rigidity so the cup will hold up under the pressure of the brewer.  My guess us that they use about 66% less plastic - less waste, less mess for the landfill. Aside from the rim, there is the filter material, which seems to be a better filter than in the full plastic cups.<br /><br />Finally, I\\'ve used the Eco-Cups over the years and really liked them, because I could use my own coffee.  The only problem is that cleaning them is not easy.  I had tried the MyCaps so I could refill the original K-cups with my own coffee.  While they worked well, cleaning the cups was messy (hence switching to the Eco-Cups).  These cups work GREAT with the MyCaps, since they are so easy to clean out and not messy at all.  Instead of trying to rinse out the used coffee, I now just peel the foil, and push the used coffee into into a container so I can compost it.  Then, with a simple rinse, it\\'s ready to refill and pop on a MyCap and brew again.  What\\'s great is that the coffee, itself is excellent and you can reuse the filters over and over with your own coffee.  Now, I keep a box of this coffee around for when I don\\'t have time to do a refill, and refill when I want a little variety.  Best of both worlds.<br /><br />By the way, refilling them with the same grind-your-own, whole bean coffee also saves money (a lot of it).  You can do that by buying <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005RO5M1Q\">San Francisco Bay 100% Organic Coffee Rainforest Blend Whole Bean 3 Lbs</a> from Amazon. How can you go wrong?',\n",
       " \"This is a nice, somewhat mellow but rich cup of coffee. I like the packaging because I have had more than a few normal K-cups either explode or backfire in my Keurig. With this type of cup, the water has no place to go but out through the filter. It's pure genius if you ask me. I do prefer the Rainforest Blend to the Fogchaser from the San Francisco Bay Coffee Company. I found the Fogchaser much more acidic and, though it could be a coincidence, my heart rate went to about 120 after 2 cups of Fogchaser. Of interest, the pack of 3 I received did not come in boxes with any descriptions on them. They were just 3 thickish cellophane bags with 12 cups in each, which I thought was strange because when I ordered the Fogchaser, each pack of 12 was in a box and I was able to give one as a gift to my coffee buddy at work. As for the coffee getting stale as others are concerned about, well.....coffee doesn't last very long around here. 12 cups goes in much less than a week and I have not noticed any staleness by storing these in my upright Keurig carousel. That's probably because this particular carousel does not leave the bottoms of the cups exposed to air. I digress. I do recommend the Rainforest Blend -- it's a great cup of coffee at a really good price. And less packaging to boot.\",\n",

As a result, it brews a decent cup of coffee on the lower setting, but it's weak as a grande.  That may work for you - at the current subscribe-n-save price it's cheap for a k-cup.<br /><br />The flavor is perfectly ok - I'm not a coffee purist, but I'd call it a dark blend more akin to Sumatran than Colombian, i.e. not so smooth.<br /><br />There is one thing I guess I should add - these things have a pod-type body, i.e. a filter-packet holding the coffee, instead of the k-cup's all-plastic body.  Typical pods come in individual sealed packets to preserve freshness, but all 12 k-pods in each SFBay box are in a single, non-resealable plastic envelope.  This means that once you've opened the envelope, you're losing freshness faster than usual.  Again I'm no purist, but this would lead to staler coffee if you're not brewing these in a hurry - or resealing them somehow?  The box offers no advice or directions.\",\n",

So much so that you could spin it fast and keep it twirling. I only say that, not because you'd need to do that, but so you can visualize that there is no tipping or hard pushing when selecting your coffee, tea, or cocoa.<br /><br />We had the self-dispenser boxes on our conter but, let's face it, it's not so attractive to do that and I like to keep a clean and organized countertop.  This is ideal if you have guests or if you like switching up your drinking choices. While it has 4 slots for drinks, you can actually have 8 different selections because you can pull from both the bottom and the top of the dispenser so we fill the dispenser slots with 2 different choices so we have 8 choices total. If you entertain or have frequent guests as we do, you can have some lighter coffees and heavier ones, tea, cocoa, espresso, etc and each guest can pick their choice to make their brew. But we like this for our choice variations equally.  I love green tea for the health benefits and taste, I like Nabob Columbian coffee for a smaller cup that's smooth, and Starbucks for a large cup, we like to keep the Milka hot chocolate on hand for a low cal decadent treat, etc. With an easy turn you can make your choice and it takes up very little room on the counter while matching our stainless appliances so it seems to fit well without looking unsightly.<br /><br />I usually list negatives in my reviews to give a balanced picture but I really don't have any for this one. It's a good size and works well.  Happy I got it.<br /><br />Note: This is similar to the cream dispensers or jelly dispensers you might see at a breakfast restaurant if that helps visualize it.

One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can\\'t find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you\\'re curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it\\'s compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I\\'d like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they\\'re reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it\\'s very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it\\'s capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn\\'t be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own \"stand\" in order to fill it properly.',\n",

I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had!

       " 'When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn\\'t much better. Third time\\'s a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you\\'ll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16\" thick, 5/32\" inside diameter, and 3/8\" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493.',\n",
       " \"At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.  Good coarse grind, check.  No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.  I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail!<br />We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean.  We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.<br />Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug.\",\n",

First off, the flat bottom makes it easy to fill. I usually run two cycles for a larger cup of coffee. With the Ekobrew the lid stays shut and doesn't leak water at the top. I was surprised how easily the grounds came out and just a quick rinse and it was ready to go again. Seems to be the best choice around for avoiding the high cost of K cups.\",\n",

ENTER the ekobrew! omg this thing is amazing. i don't know what makes it so much different and i don't care -i just care that we get an amazing cup of coffee from our machine now!

       " \"My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys.\",\n",
       " \"With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time.  Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.

Sorry, brewing 10 cups that sit in the pot for an hour til I want another cup just doesn't cut it for me.  But K-cups can get expensive (running $0.40 - $0.60 per cup depending on the type).  Well, I picked up a packaged of Cafe Bustelo, and used the individual insert K-cup, and OMG!  None of my prepacked K-cups come even close to the flavor and intensity of this coffee.  It's bold but not bitter.  A scoop is fine for making a single cup, and I am guessing I'm going to have about 40 cups per 10 oz package.  Cuts my cost down into the $0.10 range per cup!<br /><br />So if you are a K-cup user, try this brand of coffee.  You will not be disappointed.

If you don\\'t like that \\'in your face\\' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you. It\\'s not bitter, a bit floral, with a true pure coffee taste. Does it match Dunkin Donuts style coffee in taste? I\\'d say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile. The new packaging is OK (you get 2 extra K-Cups for the $$) as long as you have the room in your kitchen to store the larger single box....as opposed to storing the two 24 cartridge boxes.<br /><br />NOTE: The description of this coffee uses the words \"Medium Extra Bold\" in it\\'s packaging as opposed to the two 24 boxes version which lead me to think there was now two DIFFERENT varieties of this Donut Shop coffee....so I ordered both (wanted 98/100 anyway) but it turns out that both were the same.

When I first tried this I was not expecting much, it sounds bland, plain, everyday type of coffee.  Don't get me wrong, I have had some pretty good cups of coffee in donut shops but nothing to write home about.  When I took my first sip, I thought wow, this is amazing.  Smooth, not much of an acid taste, about as close to perfect as I could describe.  My love for this k-cup continued and continues to this day.  Many times you find a k-cup which at first is very good, but after a couple of cups you get a little sick of them; not with this one.  It has been and continues to be my absolute favorite.

Worse, about 20% of the K-Cups no longer have the full amount of coffee in them.  Additionally, I am not sure that these loose grounds won't impact the Keurig.

Thus I welcomed the opportunity to try a Starbucks flavored coffee, Natural Fusions no less.<br /><br />I love opening a fresh container of coffee to experience that heavenly burst of fresh, intense coffee aroma. When my bag of Starbucks Vanilla had its grand opening, I must say I was disappointed by the lack of a distinct vanilla aroma or anything resembling aroma. I figured I'd just have to wait for the actual brew to experience the promised vanilla flavor.<br /><br />So how is the coffee's vanilla flavor? Does it make up for the lack of that heavenly coffee scent that eluded me? Let's put it this way. If I were given a blind taste test,I'd be hard pressed to identfy this coffee as vanilla flavored. In fact, I'm not sure I could match any specific flavor to this coffee. It's obviously flavored to this taster, but I can only recognize that distant, nebulous vanilla taste because of the flavor's word printed on the bag.<br /><br />Overall this is a pleasant coffee. It's smooth, not bitter, and has a pleasant aftertaste. But if you are looking for a readily identifiable vanilla accent, you will have to be satisfied with vageuely vanilla.\",\n",

As such, each smaller pod isn\\'t producing nearly as robust a mug (double-cup) of coffee as the other version of Baronet\\'s Dark Roast Kenya AA pods.

The grind has a slight sour smell when brewing, which in turn gives a slight bitter taste.<br />Good JBMC is very smooth; on the lighter side; slightly sweet and spicy with a nice finish.  Like good 100% Kona coffee, there is no bitter aftertaste.<br />I tried different grinds, #16 and #24, and prefer the #24 grind for a single cup brew.<br />The place I normally get this bean from (Lion Coffee) did get a fresh batch of JBMC beans in last week, so I was able to compare both; and the Lion JBMC roasted whole bean wins hands down.<br />My recommendation is that if you are willing to spend $30-$50 a pound for JBMC beans, make sure it's direct from one of their certified distributors like Mavis Banks.\",\n",
       " \"Quick Review:  Island Roasters 100% Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee<br /><br />I recently received a pound of this coffee as a gift, and looked forward to getting to sample some 100% Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee.  The short version:  AMAZING!!!  I actually had to wait a couple days after trying the first sample to write this review... I was too giddy after that first taste to write an objective review.  Yes, it's THAT good.<br /><br />So, here's the review after a couple days of drinking the stuff and having some time to reflect on the experience.<br /><br />Before diving into the description of the actual drink, I need to describe the experience of simply opening the vacuum bag and inspecting the contents.  Once the bag is opened, there is this magical release of coffee perfume that is simply divine.  The smell is not something that one can adequately describe... it truly needs to be experienced.<br /><br />The beans themselves were medium-dark brown, and glistening in a uniform sheen...all were roasted perfectly and uniformly.  I quickly got down to business... ground some of the beans and started the brewing process.  The beans were so fresh and so laden with volatile oils that the ground coffee bits adhered to each other... it looked like you could have easily molded the grounds into shapes with your hands! This was really fresh coffee.  Once again, after grinding, another burst of coffee perfume pervaded the kitchen, bathing the air with an amazing aroma.<br /><br />Now for the moment of truth...tasting the stuff straight up....was...just... WOW!  Lots of coffee perfume with an incredibly complex mix of floral notes.  Very well balanced... just an amazing array of flavors, beautifully arranged with hints of sweetness along with a lovely backbone of acidity to keep everything in check.  Absolutely no hint of bitterness.  In fact, this was the most smooth coffee I'd ever had.  Delicate, complex, some ephemeral fruit notes, balanced, and most of all, just smoooooooooth.<br /><br />If you are a coffee enthusiast, give this stuff a try.<br /><br />Highly recommended!\",\n",

       " 'Something about the Brooklyn Bridge compelled me to try this product and - admittedly - I jump all over the K Cup spectrum trying each variety. I should also note that I\\'m hardly a coffee expert; even gas station coffee that has been sitting for two hours tastes fine to me. The ONLY reason I\\'d ever write a coffee review is if something about the packaging made life difficult and this is certainly the case here.<br /><br />On our first brew in the Keurig, coffee grinds were thrown out of the top of the machine and all over the counter. When we removed the pod, the foil had actually been shifted off of the base, creating about a half of an inch slit for grinds to be pushed out by the force of the water during the brewing cycle. To be fair, we tried three more pods and each exploded in their own, creative ways. On one , the hole created in the top was massive and allowed grinds to explode out of the container (I assume weak foil allowed the hole to grow during brewing. On another, for whatever reason, only an eighth of a cup of coffee was allowed out of the pod.<br /><br />OK - maybe our brewer needed cleaning or was in a state of disrepair? We put a pod of known good Timothy\\'s in and the machine performed flawlessly.<br /><br />I\\'m assuming that in this first run of product, this coffee either missed on the specification for packing for the Keurig, used some bad materials, or perhaps both. But I\\'d steer clear for a while. I just tried to send these back but Amazon doesn\\'t take returns on Grocery products. I\\'ll be calling shortly to see what can be done. As is, these are useless and a pure waste of money.<br /><br />===Updated April 19, 2012===<br /><br />As you can see, Ruth from Brooklyn Bean Roastery Coffee used this thread to offer to replace my bad lots of coffee of which I had two, the Brooklyn Bridge Blend and the Decaf blend. I took her up on the offer, wrote her, gave my address, and indicated that I would change my review if warranted based on the results. Although I got no response to my email, two boxes of coffee showed up about a week later. So we put them to the test.<br /><br />The first box that I opened was the Brooklyn Bridge Blend. I tried four of the pods, and each worked without issue. The coffee was tasty enough but the real measuring stick for me was \\'are there coffee grounds on my counter\\' and the answer in this case was no.<br /><br />Alas, we tried the Decaf. The first two pods immediately blew up during brewing. In one case, grounds came out of the coffee machine and in the other, grounds filled the coffee cup. In this case, the coffee failed my rather simple test criteria.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing is this company knew they were replacing bad batches of pods, had all the advanced warning that they needed to select a batch of known good quality, and we encountered the same issues as on our first purchase.<br /><br />I\\'m very appreciative of this company\\'s efforts to make this right but my sense is that they have immature quality control processes and I cannot recommend this brand based on the higher than acceptable probability that you will end up with a bad batch.<br /><br />===Edit May 3, 2012===<br /><br />Ruth at Brooklyn Bean sent me a sample pack which contained seven different caffeinated flavors for me to try. I very much appreciate the efforts of this company to show their quality control processes have been fixed. I am not quite done with the entire sample pack but I wanted to post my progress for those interested.<br /><br />First, though, to Lisa Lou and others who may be thinking it, I am confident that I have ruled out machine error as a factor in my previous reviews. First, the machine was fully cleaned and de-scaled before testing and I have numerous \"known good\" pods from other suppliers that function flawlessly.<br /><br />That being said, I can say that these samples have performed very well. I have tested the following:<br /><br />4 Donut Shop<br />2 Cyclone<br />4 Boardwalk Blend<br />4 French Roast<br />1 Breakfast Blend<br />1 Columbian<br />1 Fuhgeddaboutit<br /><br />Of these 17, only one time (with a Boardwalk Blend) did the pod explode in the manner described in my review. It did explode fabulously - with grinds coming onto the counter and filling the internal unit (very hard to clean) - requiring a full cleaning of the machine. This happened only once, however, and this rate of failure isn\\'t out of line with what I\\'ve experienced with other brands (they just fail in different ways - like grinds in the cup or a half full cup of coffee).<br /><br />I can say with reasonable confidence that the production issues are probably solved for the *caffeinated* flavors. I have no way of determining if the issues associated with the decaf have been solved.<br /><br />I am switching my rating to 3 Star given the spectacular (but more rare) nature of failures with this brand and given the uncertainty of the performance of the decaf variety.<br /><br />I hope this helps.',\n",
       " 'I order these K-Cups with the sole purpose of reducing my per cup cost. Understand I drink $60+ of coffee every month so I really need to cut back that cost. I purchased Cyclone and Fuhgeddaboudit as I am a fan of dark roasts in the Keurig. Cyclone\\'s description stated it was the same as Dark Magic, which is my favorite K-Cup of all time. This gave em very high hopes for it. With Amazon subscribe and save it worked out to around 42 cents a cup, which is 15-20% cheaper then I pay for K-Cups normally.<br /><br />So that I can end on a positive note, let me start with the key problem I have had with these K-Cups. They seem to brew faster then the \"normal\" ones which yields a weaker flavor. I have not timed them, so that is more of a \"seems\" like then a hard number. They are weaker, and there is no good reason for that to be other then brewing to fast. You can use the manual pulsed brew with the Keurig to get around that, but that kind of goes against the convenience factor of the Keurig system.<br /><br />I measured 12g of coffee in them, which is excellent! More grinds are better, and many K-Cups only have 8-9g in them which is way to little for this format. Also I have had NO failures or issues brewing them so far. Every K-Cup has brewed with out any failings. I have heard that some have had issues with these k-cups getting grinds in their coffee, but I have not yet experienced that. My machine is a B-60 and has been rock solid since day one, and no K-Cup has given it a problem.<br /><br />Over all these are decent K-Cups, just weak when compared to the brews they claim to match. They are much much better then San Francisco Bay Coffee OneCup which I am not likely to ever by again. Plus the fact that these K-Cups have real coffee in them places them light-years ahead of the Grove Square (which is instant coffee in a K-Cup).<br /><br />Among the competition these take second to the GM K-Cups, but are way ahead of the rest of the field.',\n",

Yuban is a \"high-end\" Kraft brand coffee offering, and it\\'s always been made with 100% Arabica beans. As of mid-2006, though, Yuban is offering a new wrinkle to help recommend it to coffee consumers, Rainforest Alliance Certification.<br /><br />That\\'s important because coffee is the world\\'s second largest commodity after oil, worth $60 billion annually, with 25 million people growing it in 50 countries on some 30 million acres, many of them in fragile, tropical ecosystems such as rainforests. Kraft is the largest United States coffee roaster, so their commitment to this certification is a big deal. Rainforest Alliance certification requires farmers to adopt best practices and meet very rigorous criteria for conserving wildlife and improving the lives of the people who grow and harvest the beans. The Yuban line guarantees that at least 30% of the coffees that it packages come from Rainforest Alliance Certified producers.<br /><br />All very interesting and commendable, but the bottom line is \"How does the coffee taste?\" Well, I\\'ve made a number of pots since I\\'ve rediscovered the brand, and I must say that it performs pretty well.

So when supplying choices of blends for guests, I'm including Veranda as a milder blend for those who don't like French Roast or Sumatra or other bold blends. I find that there is a bit of woodiness, but also a slight flavor of nuts and cocoa. It's a pleasant blend of coffee and a very good cup if you don't want something awfully strong.

       " 'I\\'m a certified chocoholic with a weight problem.  I had heard that cacao nibs had all the health benefits of dark chocolate (way more, actually) without the sugar and junk food aspects.  They are loaded with antioxidants and have those powerful endorphin releasing stimulants.  They are also quite high in fiber (but also in saturated fats).<br /><br />I got my big pile of Navitas Naturals nibs and dug right in.  Well - these are a bit of an acquired taste; but once acquired, they really satisfy.  Cacao nibs are broken pieces of raw whole cacao beans that have been dried (and that\\'s it).  They are brown, with a dark cocoa smell, and a seductive texture that\\'s partly like a coffee bean (crunchy and hard), and partly like a piece of chocolate (buttery with a crisp and then melting fat).  The flavor initially gives you a cocoa hit and then a winey fermented flavor that is hard to describe.  The aftertaste is bitter like baking chocolate.  Like a coffee bean, there\\'s some fibrous grit with the aftertaste after the creamy fats have dissolved on your tongue.  My first impressions was \"phew - that\\'s disgusting\".  The winey flavor was off-putting and the bitterness in the aftertaste was hard to take.  That didn\\'t prevent me from immediately having more, however - as the crisp rich creamy quality made me want more.  After a few pinches (maybe 3/4s of a tablespoon) I was flying!  I mean, these things are POTENT.  They really are loaded with all those endorphin releasing stimulants - and man they wake you up and then make you feel loved.  Over the next few days I kept a big baggie of these in my pack and ate them whenever I wanted a cup of coffee.  The stimulant effect is totally as strong as coffee - and more.  To go with the speed, there\\'s a feeling of well being and intellectual stimulation that\\'s seductive in the extreme.  I began to almost enjoy the odd powerful flavor.  My only concerns at this point are whether these are addictive!  About 1/2 way through my bag I have yet to hit a stem or a stone or an inedible piece (unlike what I\\'ve heard with some other brands).  The flavor and texture is pretty consistent as I work my way through too - pretty good for a totally raw organic product.<br /><br />I found that I could grind them up into powder in the blender and use the powder to \"cocoa\" up various foods (especially ones bearing some sweetness).  For example, after my workout I\\'d put a tablespoon of nibs and a tablespoon of chia seeds in the blender and grind nice and fine and then toss in a fist full of frozen blueberries, a glug of Walden Farms zero calorie chocolate sauce, 8 oz water and two scoops of whey protein powder (chocolate flavor, of course) and then blend.  It all whips up into a rich chocolatey blueberry shake that packs the nutritional wallop of a steak dinner with omega 3 oils, TONS of antioxidants, and a wicked emotional and blood sugar pick-me-up.  You can buy the powder pre-ground, but I imagine the goodies keep better in this coarsely cracked version.<br /><br />All in all - I think of cacao nibs as much as a drug like coffee as I do a food.  People who eat ultra-dark chocolate for the health aspects should absolutely check nibs out because my body tells me they have WAY MORE of the chemical goodies of chocolate with far less sugar and fat.  They also are brimming with a rich raw cocoa flavor that\\'s weird and wonderful and hard to describe.  If you are bent in this way - this stuff is wonderful.',\n",

Thus I welcomed the opportunity to try a Starbucks flavored coffee, Natural Fusions no less.<br /><br />I love opening a fresh container of coffee to experience that heavenly burst of fresh, intense coffee aroma. When my bag of Starbucks Vanilla had its grand opening, I must say I was disappointed by the lack of a distinct vanilla aroma or anything resembling aroma. I figured I'd just have to wait for the actual brew to experience the promised vanilla flavor.<br /><br />So how is the coffee's vanilla flavor? Does it make up for the lack of that heavenly coffee scent that eluded me? Let's put it this way. If I were given a blind taste test,I'd be hard pressed to identfy this coffee as vanilla flavored. In fact, I'm not sure I could match any specific flavor to this coffee. It's obviously flavored to this taster, but I can only recognize that distant, nebulous vanilla taste because of the flavor's word printed on the bag.<br /><br />Overall this is a pleasant coffee. It's smooth, not bitter, and has a pleasant aftertaste. But if you are looking for a readily identifiable vanilla accent, you will have to be satisfied with vageuely vanilla.\",\n",

       " 'I want to start by addressing the people giving low ratings because the beans aren\\'t \"oily\" enough. If you\\'ve ever had a real espresso, one made by a licensed barista in Italy, you\\'d know that espresso beans aren\\'t oily; they\\'re not even usually that dark. If you see black beans, you\\'re going to get a bitter cup of coffee no matter how you make it. It is the fresh grinding process and pressurized steam that make espresso so dark and strong in the cup, not burnt beans! This coffee is used in the great majority of Italian households and restaurants; I think most of the bars use a different brand but some of the ones I frequented around Florence used Lavazza. I can tell you from first-hand experience that when you order an espresso in Italy, the barista doesn\\'t get beans that look black...that only happens at Starbucks where they don\\'t care about the coffee being bitter because, as these low-star reviewers prove, a lot of American coffee drinkers wouldn\\'t know how coffee is supposed to look or taste.<br /><br />These beans are the perfect color; medium to dark brown, uniformly roasted. When you grind them, the aroma fills the kitchen. (By the way detractors, that\\'s another way to tell good coffee. If you don\\'t get a big release of aroma when you grind the beans, it means they\\'ve been over-roasted and the oils are all gone...perhaps except for that little sheen you want to be on the surface...I\\'d rather have the oils still in the bean, personally.)<br /><br />Just for the fun of it, I decided to test this against my favorite coffee for my drip coffee maker. I was actually quite surprised at how rich, dark, and mellow the coffee came out of a rather poor (but quick and convenient) method of making coffee. I knew this would make perfect espresso, but I honestly didn\\'t think the American-style coffee methods would work so well too. There is even a bit of crema on top of the cup...from a drip coffee maker! To see how much foam you get from an espresso machine, check out the pictures I\\'ve posted at the top of the page.<br /><br />Lavazza is now going to be the only brand of coffee in my house.

The Lavazza Espresso (black tin, 100% arabica claimed) tastes better than this blend, but after having tried Illy's moka grind, the different blends from Lavazza, Kimbo, Segafredo, and also blends from the local coffee roasters, I actually think that a robusta/arabica blend works best for a moka pot; just not this one. Overall, I'd say that I got what I paid for, but I didn't get what I wanted and I was seduced by the 93 or so 4/5 star reviews for this coffee. I'd really give it a 2.5 or 3 but then again, all taste is subjective, That being said, this is a reasonable coffee (considering taste vs. price), but I'll probably switch back to my regular (and unfortunately more expensive) blend.\",\n",

Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup.

My taste test revealed exactly that... a mild, relatively tasteless coffee more like their dishwater Daybreak than the old Caribou blend. Caribou (I got this second hand) claims that their flagship blend is more of a light roast than a medium roast and they made the change accordingly. Yeah, sure. Nice try but we all know that the wholesale price of coffee has skyrocketed. Sounds to me, the skeptic, that perhaps they have been forced to switch to a cheaper coffee with less gusto and more bitterness to maintain their competitive price points. How sad.

I then promptly set off on a mission to find the coffee that \"rocked my boat\" given the fact that I was a sworn dunkin donut coffee drinker for years.<br /><br />I am not terribly fond of flavored coffees in general although they are nice to have on occassion, so I tried all of the Senseo coffees and eventually found that the Kenya Blend was the best of the lot given my individual taste for coffees.<br /><br />And then they came out with the breakfast blend. This makes a superb cup of coffee and it has effectively ended my murmurings for Dunkin Donut to get on board with Senseo and make a pod coffee just for the Senseo.

It has a rich, full-bodied flavor, neither bitter nor astringent. The Senseo coffee machine can make 1 4 oz cup, 2 4 oz cups, or a single 8 oz cup at a time. The self-contained pods use a tea bag filter-type paper and are approximately 2&quot; in diameter.<p>Right now, the price averages 25 cents per 4 ounce cup. The Senseo makes it with a bit of frothe on the top, and this medium roast coffee is fine straight up, or try it with a little sweetner and a dollop of Hazelnut creamer as I do.<p>I do envision the price point coming down a bit, as the Senseo system becomes the US equivalent of the European sensation.

Even the dark roast is really not strong enough to qualify as espresso, so I suggest you just use the double packets and make a large cup.<p>Here is a further hint.  Use a 10 oz cup, not a standard 8.  Then put your milk in the cup and microwave for 30 seconds BEFORE you make the coffee.  After coffee is make make sure to stir with a stirrer.

The coffee it produces is far better than anything that comes in a can and certainly will give Starbucks a run for their $6 venti's.<br /><br />Think of the DE pods as an easy way to get fresh, hot, pleasant coffee in about 30 seconds.  Use two pods, one dark and one medium for a fuller flavor profile or, if you're a low-caf freak, do one decaf and one caf.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that you've gotta pre-warm the mug you're using if you like hot coffee-and the best way to do this is with some leche in the microwave.  One final tip which out to assuage some of the folks who think the DE's are weak:<br /><br />Run a few seconds of hot water through the machine without a pod inside.  This gets the metal plates wet and hot.  A good thing.  Put your pods on the wet plates and close the machine.  Let it sit for a few seconds.  This lets the coffee get wet and swell a bit.  This is called pre-infusion in the espresso trade and if you pull your 8 oz of pleasure now, it will taste pretty darned good.<br /><br />-J\",\n",

       " 'I agree 100% with \"nuttinbutdtruth\"--this coffee is great and, thankfully, does not have the Starbucks \"burnt\" flavor which comes from roasting the beans to a higher internal bean temperature (i.e., burning them).  The Eight O\\' Clock 100% Colombian coffee is smooth with a real coffee flavor.  I have also bought Eight O\\' Clock Original coffee, and it tastes similar to the Colombian--both are great tasting and apparently are American Roast (\"American Roast is a light to medium roast...This roast results in a full bodied, acidic cup of coffee.\").<br /><br />Starbucks coffee, on the other hand, tastes to me like French Roast (\"French roast is similar to Espresso roast only a little bit darker. This roasting style produces a full bodied coffee that has low acidity and a dominating bittersweet flavor.\") or maybe Italian Roast (\"Italian roasted coffee beans are nearly completely black in color. This roasting style produces a coffee that is very weak bodied with strong burnt flavors and low acidity.\").  Each to their own, but according to many coffee experts, \"...acidity is a good thing when it comes to coffee\", and as stated on one coffee website: \"In actuality the medium roast better preserves the true coffee bean as the darker roasts burn off some of the natural coffee oils and cause it to have a harsher taste. The medium roasts allow you to better savoir the way the coffee bean was intended to taste.\"  Also, according to the same website: \"A darker roast can actually make a lower quality coffee bean taste better. The bean no longer relies on the flavors from its origin and leans more on the burnt flavor that results from the darker roasting process.\"<br /><br />According to another coffee website: \"Maximum aroma and flavor, is generally found at the lighter end of the dark range. At the darkest end of the dark range, coffee has lost all of its acidity and has a distinctly burnt flavor.\"  And according to Wikipedia: \"At lighter roasts, the bean will exhibit more of its \\'origin flavor\\'; the flavors created in the bean by the soil and weather conditions in the location where it was grown. Coffee beans from famous regions like Java, Kenya, Hawaiian Kona, and Jamaican Blue Mountain are usually roasted lightly so their signature characteristics dominate the flavor. As the beans darken to a deep brown, the origin flavors of the bean are eclipsed by the flavors created by the roasting process itself. At darker roasts, the \\'roast flavor\\' is so dominant that it can be difficult to distinguish the origin of the beans used in the roast.\"<br /><br />As a fan of American Roast coffee with a truer coffee bean flavor, I think this Eight O\\' Clock 100% Colombian coffee is extremely hard to beat.

The Espresso will have to be very good to get us away from this one though. I do hear that the two are comparable - we'll see.

I'm not sorry I had two boxes of the Espresso as this was a very acceptable alternative to Emeril's product, but I don't believe I'll be ordering it again.

Therefore, I was rather surprised when I opened the box and saw the different type of pod.  With a filter bottom the pod seems much more environmentally friendly.  There was no residue at the bottom of my mug so the filter did a good job.  I agree with other reviewers of the need to keep these pods in a vacuum sealed container (or zip lock bag) but I think the use of less platics is a good thing.<br /><br />I have a B60 and these fit perfectly in the machine. I used the large cup setting and the strength of the coffee was perfect for my taste (I prefer stronger coffee).  Before purchasing Fog Chaser I was buying Jet Fuel.',\n",
       " \"These do not look like regular K-cups. And perhaps they won't keep as long because the bottom looks like it's made of rounded cloth, kind of like a tea bag. But they fit Keurig machines just fine, are less expensive, and most importantly I think this coffee tastes better than the coffee in plastic K-cups. I actually prefer the fact that the bottom is not made of plastic. I never liked the idea that my hot coffee was being strained through a plastic cup. In fact, I just ordered more.\",\n",
       " 'Don\\'t be alarmed when you receive these and they don\\'t look like a standard K-cup. These are not K-cups, but dowill fit in your machine. I thought I had ordered the wrong product at first. These simply have a plastic ring at the top so that they\\'ll fit in your K-cup holder and the rest of it is like a standard coffee filter. I\\'ve only tried Fog Chaser (ordered all 3 flavors) and was surprised that I liked the coffee. However, because it\\'s using a filter rather than the K-cup technology, it does leave a sediment in the bottom of your cup. I find this also happens when using the My K-Cup filter with whatever brand of coffee I use.<br /><br />You will need to store the \"k-cups\" in a ziploc to keep them fresh. The 36-count come packaged in 3 plastic bags of 12 each. This is nice so that you only have to open up one 12 pack at a time so the others can stay fresh.<br /><br />I\\'m mostly neutral, but lean more toward \"would buy again\".',\n",
       " 'This coffee is great in my Keurig and alot more reasonably priced here at Amazon. Shipping was fast and worry free. I really like the fact that this comes packed in 10 individual packs of 8 k-cups each. The reason for this is that these k-cups are different in their construction. Each one is plastic at the top but filter for the lower 3/4 of the k-cup. At first I thought..oh no..I see a big mess coming, but to my great surprise, everything went perfectly. I like this design for two reasons, one..they are made with green practices in every way possible, and..two..they brew alot faster than the regular k-cups. The taste is great, bold and deep mellow flavor, this is my new coffee for sure.',\n",
       " 'I am the buyer for a 20-person department.  The folks who like a bold strong coffee love this one.  I like it as well, but I use the 10-oz setting when I make it instead of my typical 8-oz.<br />\"Fogchaser\" sums it up pretty well.  This will clear your head and get you ready to roll.<br />I also love that there is less packaging.  I must admit to a bit of guilt over the whole K-Cup disposal situation.  (I make people use china coffee cups and am happy to wash them!)  These do not have the plastic outer cup.  I keep them in a plastic container with a sealed lid instead of in the K-Cup carousel to keep them fresher.  But I gotta tell you--opening that lid yields the most wonderful coffee aroma.',\n",
       " \"Finally, a robust, bold coffee from a Keurig coffee pot.  I had trouble finding one that wasn't wimpy, but this is it!  And it is cheaper than any other.  As an added benefit, the k-cups are constructed in a much more earth-friendly way, no plastic cup.  Why don't other brands go this route?\",\n",
       " 'I was really lured in by the price and eco-friendly \"pod\" cup. I had read the good and bad reviews and decided it was worth trying the Fog Chaser. Well, I loved it! My cup was as bold and rich as traditional plastic K-cups and better than the reuseable cups (My K-cup, Ekobrew). This will be a mainstay in my coffee selection due to the flavor and affordability. I highly recommend trying it.<br /><br />Hopefully, someone can comment on whether these will work for the new Keurig Vue machine.',\n",
       " \"I rarely rate things 5 stars, this coffee deserves the top rating. It is incredibly good, I don't think I want a cup of coffee and then I remember these are in the carousel for my Keurig machine, I change my mind in a heartbeat. It's like having a box of your favorite snack in the cupboard and trying to resist eating it, but you know it's there and you keep thinking about it.<br /><br />The flavor of this San Fransisco Bay coffee is rich, complex, and delicious. I can't think of a cup of coffee that I've bought anywhere that can beat the bold, rich flavor of this brand. It's like drinking a glass of fine wine. My favorite k-cup previous to this was Tulley's Kona Blend.<br /><br />The packaging of the individual coffee pod threw me off because when I opened the plastic bag with the pods in it, a very strong aroma of coffee filled the air. I wondered if the paper filter bottoms of the pods wouldn't let the coffee get stale, so I put them in a ziplock baggie. Time will tell I guess if the paper filter will allow the coffee to get stale or not. On the other hand I liked that there was a more green solution to the regular plastic coffee pod holder. I'm torn on this, I 'think' I'd rather have the pods be the more usual plastic in order to preserve freshness, but time will tell. I doubt any of the pods I have will have time to ever get stale however, because I'm drinking them all the time.\",\n",
       " 'I am one of those guys that dont like the rising price of k cups. This works great and makes a pretty good<br />cup of coffee. It is very easy to clean up.. just throw away. At the current price of 16.99 it is about .47<br />per cup or .40 with subscribe and safe. I also like saving money using the EKOBREW the refillable k cup filter, when you use that you can put in your own grinds and it costs about .25 for starbucks. This is a little easier when you are finished though and is a Good Value.',\n",
       " \"Really my title sums up my opinion of this cup altogether. It does make a nice, heart large cup of dark roast coffee, and $25 for 48 cups as the preorder price was outstanding. At that price, I don't think I've ever really seen better, but at the same time the brew doesn't seem quite as bold or earthy tasting as a cup of Green Mountain Dark Magic or Emeril's Big Easy Bold. I prefer a robust large cup on almost every brew, and I've realized that even the Ice Brew K-Cups are basically the same thing; a cup of coffee with extra grounds for brewing a small amount stronger...so I brew iced coffee with my Extra Bold k-cups. I did the math on weight, and these weigh in at just under a cup of Dark Magic or Sumatran Reserve, but I'd still say my favorites (by taste,) are the brands I've listed above or Tully's Italian or French Roast, Caribou Obsidian, Starbucks Dark Sumatra, or even Barista Prima French and Italian Roasts. The only other thing I can note about these is that the construction of the pods is about perfect; I didn't find any grinds in the box leaving me to believe there were no leaking pods. Almost all the pods had a little air puffing the foil out; which I've noticed a lot of the Keurig brands have flat foils, anyways, so I'm not even sure if it matters that much, although I've had grinds brew through on some of the flat pods. The only other difference I can mention is the  material of the foil top is different than Keurig brand pods; these are slightly harder and smoother (almost like a plastic or polymer,) but it doesn't seem to effect the brew process at all, and I didn't seem to get any grinds in my cup, so all in all it just doesn't matter to me. Still better than brewing through a regular coffee pot (even from fresh ground beans,) and I don't think I'll ever get tired of my Keurig coffee maker.\",\n",
       " \"With K-Cups being so expensive, I haven't ordered much for a while.  Most prices are over .60 per cup.  That's a lot of money a month for two daily cups of coffee.  Nothing is cheap, and neither are these at about .50 per cup.  I remember the good ol' days when the K-cups were not more than about .35 each, and it wasn't that long ago.<br /><br />I have been buying K-Cups at Costco most recently, and the Tully's they carry are okay.  Newman's Own are just okay too.  Those run .475 per cup, so that's been a little better.  This Martinson coffee comes close to the same price as the ones at Costco, but the flavor is superior.  This is the first cup of coffee I have in the morning. It's got a richer flavor, fresher somehow, than the others I have tried.\",\n",
       " \"I really like a bold cup of coffee.<br /><br />Generally if I want flavored coffee I will flavor it myself as flavoreds don't come in dark roast bold, however I expect to not have to flavor it to drink it. I want my base coffee to be an experience in itself and something that I look forward too.<br /><br />Martinson Dark Roast K-cup does not give me that coffee experience. Although the coffee is smooth, I will give it that, it is bland and kinda tastes like instant.<br /><br />Honestly I didn't spend the money I did on a Keurig machine to get a cup of instant coffee. I can do that with a pot of boiling water and a cheap jar of whatever.<br /><br />While I do not expect the same experience as I get when I grind my beans fresh and brew it in my french press, I do expect a reasonably fresh ground taste.<br /><br />On a positive note the presentation of the K-cups and the box are top notch. The black/gray combination makes the coffee look like it is presented in a tuxedo. 5 stars for the marketing department on this one as the look on the shelf is bound to grab lots of attention so that people will buy it at least once.\",\n",
       " 'I prefer deep, dark roasted coffees but many people don\\'t.  My mother used standard household blends such as Folger\\'s for many years.  When she received her Keuring machine she started to experiment with other brands and blends.  She occasionally drinks a flavored coffee but this has become her favorite.  I get her a couple of boxes a month and she loves it.  I have tried it and here is my take on this blend:<br /><br />The body (or \"mouth-feel\") is light to medium.  The acidity is medium-low so it won\\'t have too much of a bite, especially of you use cream.  The flavor is surprisingly complex with some spice (maybe cardamom or anise and a little pepper) as well as a rich coffee finish.  This will not replace my favorite dark roasts but I will keep it on hand for those guests who find a \"Starbucks-type\" of coffee too strong or bitter.  If you, like my mother, enjoy a \"regular\" blend I don\\'t think that it get\\'s better than this.',\n",
       " 'Green Mountain is our favorite coffee.  We switched from grinding our own to K cups recently.  We still love Vermont Country Blend and Heifer Hope, but this is the ultimate K-cup for us.  A medium roast, rich but not bitter.  It satisfies every time.',\n",
       " \"I have a Keurig in the office for guests (and myself) but I learned that most of my guests prefer a lighter roast than I do. After tasting the Veranda Blend, I found it was light, but very aromatic and you could still add sugar and cream and it was very similar to a good restaurant coffee. So when supplying choices of blends for guests, I'm including Veranda as a milder blend for those who don't like French Roast or Sumatra or other bold blends. I find that there is a bit of woodiness, but also a slight flavor of nuts and cocoa. It's a pleasant blend of coffee and a very good cup if you don't want something awfully strong. Some lighter roasts are acid to me, but this one seems to be balanced.\",\n",
       " \"They leak.  Regardless of what anyone else tells you, or how they tell you to make them not leak (make sure kap is on snuggly, hold the lever down, make sure the cup is not overfilled), they leak out the top of the cup most of the time.  You WILL have sediment (grounds) in your cup of coffee, and you WILL be wiping coffee out of the chamber housing.  That said, I've been using them for about six months and I continue to use them, because they do give you the opportunity to use your favorite coffee with your favorite coffee maker (The Keurig).  I've used both, and I prefer the My-Kap vs the Keurig My K-cup reusable filter because the coffee always seems to be weaker with the Keurig reusable filter.  It also leaves more sediment than the My-Kap.  There's my opinion.  That and 40 cents will buy you a K-cup.\",\n",
       " 'K cups can be expensive and you often have your very own favorite coffee anyway.  Why not reuse those K cups!  This product is easy to use and will enable you to get an even better brew in your Keurig brewer when you use your own coffee.  The refillable brewing accessory for the Keurig makes an acceptable cup of coffee, but not a great cup.  My-Kap makes a huge difference.  The product will be shipped from an independent vendor, but your My-Kaps will arrive within just a few days.  Be sure to place the print on the cap up when you insert it into the K cup so that it will fit easily into the cup.  You will choose the same brew size you normally use with the K cups.  The number  of times you can reuse the K cups varies from coffee company to coffee company, but you will still be able to reuse most of them at least 4 to 6 times.  I have reused several K cups 10 or more times before discarding them.',\n",
       " \"It's true, the lids do leak some when making a coffee, but other than that this product will fit the bill. The lids fit snugly into the tops of used KCups. I do not yet know how many times you can reuse the cup, I am still on the first one.<br /><br />This product has a huge benefit over the mesh screen system sold by Kurig. The mesh screen severely restricts water flow forcing high back pressure on your Kurig coffee system pump. If you use the screen often this will shorten the life of your pot significantly. Back pressure is the slow death of any pump system, from the Kurig to your swimming pool. Reusing KCups solves this problem. Paper filters offer much less resistance to water flow.<br /><br />You also get a fuller, better tasting cup of coffee from the paper filter Kcup versus mesh.<br /><br />One negative, it is a slight pain to clean the Kcups for initial reuse, but not much more than cleaning the screen. After the initial cleaning, it is no harder than the mesh screen.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Extend the life of your pot and get a better cup of coffee. Dump the screen and get the lid!<br /><br />9/3/10 Update: If you want to prevent leakage around the top of your lid, stretch a small piece of Saran Wrap (household kitchen plastic wrap) over the lid, then place it into the filter. Your Keurig will pierce the wrap while the wrap seals the lid in place. No more leaks!\",\n",
       " 'I love my Keurig brewer but soon realized 3 significant problems; the high cost of K-cup coffee, wasteful packaging and limited selection. Enter the My-Kap which addresses all three. The only drawbacks I have found are the initial high cost for these plastic disks and the leakage that occurs while brewing with them. However, they will pay for themselves after a few uses and by solving the other problems, perhaps makes the cost worthwhile. As for the leakage, my experience has typically been a small dribble of water that runs down the side of the K-cup. Still, I get a very good cup of the coffee of MY chosing.<br />  Now there is a solution for the leakage problem too. On this same page, there is a post from \"D.Dobson\"five2one\" who adds a small piece of \"Glad Press-n-Seal\" plastic wrap over the top of the My-Kap. Doing so forms a tight seal around the top rim of the K-cup. I tried this and have not had a leak since! It also keeps coffee grounds from spilling out of the top hole.<br />  There are other great alternatives to re-using K-cups, namely the EZ-Cup and the Solofill which are washable cup & lid assemblies. For me though, I prefer the My-Kaps. I can prepare multiple cups of various coffees ahead of time, place them in ziplock bags and label them. The different color My-Kaps come in handy here too.<br />  One final note on K-cups. If you are gentle with them you will get many re-uses before they fail. You can wash them in soap & water as long as you rinse them thoroughly and don\\'t use a brush. A gentle puff of air through the bottom hole will push the filter out like a parachute aiding in cleaning. Some gentle suction will then draw it back in. Also when brewing, use the same bottom hole on the cup. Note it\\'s 12 o\\'clock position and place the cup as such in your machine. You will feel it drop in when properly aligned.',\n",
       " 'I have been using these caps constantly for the past 2 weeks and haven\\'t experienced any problems with water leakage, poor fit, etc. The trick I found was to push the cap into the K-Cup so that the top rim of the Kap is even with the top rim of the K-Cup. I fill used K-Cups and Kap them days before I plan to use them and seal the hole in the top of the Kap and the hole in the bottom of the K-Cup with those \"dot-type\" stickers one can get in office supply stores and discount stores. This keeps the coffee/tea/hot chocolate, etc. from getting stale before brewing. To clean used K-Cups, I bought a cheap eyebrow brush to \"sweep\" the wet grounds out of the Cup and filter after use. I do keep numerous used, clean and dry K-Cups to fill and cap while recently used K-Cups are drying. I\\'ve found that the regular grind coffee that I buy in the grocery store works well for brewing as fine grind coffee tends to clog the needle in the brewer. To get the correct strength in tea, I fill the K-Cup with the equivalent of 2 teabags, then cap. For coffee, I fill the K-Cup to nearly the bottom edge of the K-Kap. So far my Kaps are working well and saving me money. Before discovering these, I was somewhat regretting having bought my Keurig brewer because of the high cost of the K-Cups and the number of people living in my house who drink multiple cups of coffee daily. The bill for buying K-Cups was starting to look like my mortgage payment! These saved my bank account.',\n",

Later I read the directions from the manufacturer and it said you may have to hold the handle down while making a cup of whatever.  I thought I'd be able to insert the My-Kup into the coffee maker and just walk away.<br />I'd say I was wrong on that one, but will try holding down the handle the next time I use it, and I'm almost positive this will help tremendously.\",\n",

Long time ago (maybe 20 yrs) I tried the freeze dried stuff and thought it was a bit on the bitter side in taste, so never tried it again.  So here I am, years later writing Taster's Choice parent company asking for samples.  They sent me a few, and boy was I blown away at how tasty the Vanilla and Hazlenut flavors were.  I ended up gong to the local Walmart and cleaned their shelf of these flavors.  Yes, that is how well I liked this coffee.  HOWEVER, as tasty as this stuff is, there is a down side...<br /><br />The reviews on amazon are correct, in that the size of the individual packets are RIDICULOUSLY small.  This is why I am giving a four star rating instead of a five star.  Be forewarned - if you want a typical 8-oz cup of this coffee in the morning, you WILL have to use two full packets to achieve the taste of a regular strength of coffee.  Having said that, know that you are told on the box of this product that you are buying a TWENTY COUNT box.  In reality, it is a TEN COUNT box.  Who do you know only drinks 6-oz of coffee in their cup each morning?  That is what the packets are - 6 oz!  I do not, repeat, do not like strong coffee, so even I would have to complain that this company needs to stop pre-packing for a 6-oz cup.  Nescafe needs to sell this product in a single jar container so that customers can choose how much coffee to stir in their cup each day.<br /><br />Its all about profit, I know.  But if Nescafe wants to truly listen to customers, then they will stop pre-packing such small quantities and let the consumer have this product in a larger container.

Please go to the website and complain.<br /><br />I am sure that Nestle has done this from greed alone. This way they can charge much more for less product.

Normally I'm not one to do reviews, but since this product is so expensive, I wanted to share my experience.<br /><br />I've been working really hard recently to cut my sugar intake. After reading rave reviews on Amazon about Sweet Tree Coconut Palm sugar, and doing a little research, I debated for 2 weeks, and then decided to just go get some even though it was $5 for a pound. (my health is more important) I started out by using some in my steel cut oats yesterday, which I really liked! I also used it in my coffee yesterday in place of regular sugar, but I noticed little dark things floated to the top. I know it's pretty raw, so I figured, maybe they were little fibers from the tree, or perhaps it was something with that batch of coffee? So I just scooped the little dark floaters out, and drank my coffee. Which tasted pretty good with the palm sugar! I was so pleased, that I was very excited to have my coffee this morning with my new found sweetener.<br /><br />This morning (not more than 10 minutes ago) I made some coffee again with my palm sugar, and before I even had a chance to drink it... more little floaters! As I pushed them to the sides of my white cup, one I noticed for sure had LEGS on it! Yes, my friends... it was a BUG!! I dumped my coffee imediately, and made some more with(unfortunately) my raw organic sugar that I still have. No floaters. So it's definitely not in the coffee... it's in the palm sugar! Has anyone else had an experience/noticed this? I know it's supposed to be healthier and all... but for $5 I'd like my sugar to not have little bugs in it. That's NOT the extra minerals I had in mind! Maybe I just got a bad bag?

       " \"My wife first found this in Walgreen's and bought both Vanilla and Hazelnut flavors just to try them out. And here is our verdict: WE LOVED THEM. The Vanilla one, that is. We didn't care for the Hazelnut too much. And since my wife hates favors in her coffee you can say that the Vanilla flavored Splenda is really good. Now why would I mention by name where she bought it first? Well because you should know that it cost us a dollar more per box that what we would have spend here in Amazon. And since this product qualifies for free shipping it's a no lose situation. Here is a little more on this item:<br /><br />The Vanilla Splenda tastes like... well, Vanilla; the good vanilla, not the artificial stuff. It's delicate and subtle. You can easily taste both the vanilla and your favorite ground coffee separately and yet appreciate how wonderfully they come together. (Can you tell that I am sipping a hot cup of vanilla flavored coffee as I am writing?)<br /><br />The Hazelnut Splenda is a little too roasted for my taste, and in my opinion it kind of kills the otherwise nutty hazelnut flavor. But don't let that stop you from at least trying it. You might like it a lot more that we did.<br /><br />THERE IS NO AFTERTASTE. I hate Nutra Sweet because of that.<br /><br />Splenda No Calorie Sweetener comes in three flavors Vanilla, Hazelnut and Mocha. I give Vanilla 5 stars, Hazelnut 4 Stars and I have not tasted the Mocha yet. But if you are wondering if you should try this product, the answer is YES, go for it, you will love it. You will even impress a couple of friends too. Que te aproveche.\",\n",

I prefer an Americano, so I liked this roast.<br /><br />I tested the Dark Magic blend on Keurig\\'s small cup (5.25 oz) setting to capture the strongest flavor. It was a nice improvement from Green Mountain\\'s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00390VIQI\">Fair Trade Gingerbread</a> I drank earlier in the week.

In fact I don\\'t think a day goes by that I don\\'t have at least 1 cup of this flavor, if not more. Don\\'t let the words dark and extra bold scare you off - this coffee is rich, smooth and in many ways mellow. Its not overly acidic, it does\\'t taste burnt, its just a good cup of \"coffee flavored coffee\". It works well with most flavored creamers, sweeteners, but is a pleasant cup in its pure and unadorned form as well.',\n",

This coffee brewed up strong, but had a bit of an empty, bitter finish.  The caffeine content is acceptable.  The package could have been treated a little better during shipping as there were lots of dents, crushed corners and sides, and evidence of bending on the sides of the k-cups.  None of the cups have thus far shown a broken seal though.<br /><br />Overall this is an acceptable extra bold style k-cup, but there are better options out there.  My favorites have been the Newman's Own and the Sumatran Reserve.  I haven't tried the Black Diamond K-cups as they are a bit pricey right now also.  I'll probably end up using a coupon and buying my preferred flavors in a brick and mortar store nearby for a better price, or ordering some Coffee People 50-count extra bold flavors.  Their boxes have had pretty stable pricing for the past 6 months or so.<br /><br />If you are out of options, this is a cheaper substitute for a pricier extra bold flavor.  I wish Amazon could sort out their supply issues and keep K-cup prices a little more stable.  Lastly, I wouldn't buy these again if I had other similar priced options.<br /><br />TL;DR - These are okay, but go for other extra bold flavors if they are priced about the same.\",\n",

The coffee flavour is weak, if you prefer starbucks drinks with 2 shots of espresso... you're not gonna like this.

When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it\\'s really a \"to each his or her own\" thing. But I\\'ve tried \\'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril\\'s Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril\\'s Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they\\'re bold. I\\'ve tried the \"Midnight Magic\" brand; I\\'ve tried the \"Jet Fuel\" brand; I\\'ve tried the \"Donut Shop\" brand; I\\'ve tried all of the \"Extra Bolds\"; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril\\'s Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What\\'s really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril\\'s Big Easy Bold, you won\\'t lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril\\'s.<br /><br />There is no question here.

True, Newman\\'s (RIP) is hardly as dark a roast or as thick a beverage, but the flavor punches through very robustly and is totally superior in the area that counts the most to me -- taste.  It\\'s a lot \"Bold\"er than this brand.<br /><br />One of my favorite dark roasts is the Coffee People line, even of decafs, which truly bury the \"Big Easy Bold\" in the taste department, too, even if one drinks the decaf.  Diedrich coffees come to mind as well as clear winners.<br /><br />Maybe I\\'m spoiled, but I tend to use fewer of the ready-mixed K-Cups brand coffees than employing the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI\">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a> and selecting my own brand and grind.

You know you are drinking a strong, flavorful cup of coffee when you pop this in your machine.  It will stand up to cream, and is the perfect wake up beverage.  I love Coffee People French Roast, and Timothy's Rainforest Espresso, but I have to say they now taste almost ordinary to me after having discovered Big Easy Bold.

But now, I have experienced Teeccino, and I love it.<br /><br />All coffee drinkers will know what I mean when I say there is a different feeling and mental/psychological experience between drinking a cup of rich, dark coffee and a cup of wonderful tea. Both are great, but if you really want coffee, the tea just does not have the same look or texture/feel in the mouth like coffee has.<br /><br />So Teeccino is a great substitute for coffee because it meets these qualities I look for. It is dark, sometimes black, in the cup. It is rich smelling, and has the body or texture in the mouth like a coffee product. Just like coffee and tea, you can drink it plain or add cream and sugar.<br /><br />This particular blend with the chocolate is wonderful. I, personally, do not add any sugar at all, but I do use a little creamer sometimes.<br /><br />I like a cup of Teecinno in the late afternoon and evening because it is herbal and has absolutely NO caffeine. I can have my coffee-like drink without the worry of being up all night long. We all know that even de-caffinated drinks still have caffeine and therefore can still cause problems for some people, but this never had caffeine so there are no problems.<br /><br />Finally, I tried other brands of a similar product, but I promise you, Teeccino is the best of all of them, and it has multiple flavors to match the specialty coffees on the market.',\n",

That one also includes a Mudslide flavor, but we thought it had a slight coconut taste we didn\\'t care for.  I like the Kahlua brand Kahlua coffee, but the flavor portion is a little strong. But my VERY, VERY, VERY favorite flavor is this Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle flavor.  It\\'s just the right balance of \"coffee\" to \"flavor\" ratio.  You can taste it, but still taste the coffee.  And my kitchen smells heavenly!  But a lot of it boils down to personal taste and preferences.

While it\\'s brewing I get the distinct aroma of cinnamon rolls. I brew in a Keurig B40 and choose the 9.25oz serving size and think the brew strength is exactly right. My usual method of serving is to heat about 6 ounces of skim milk in the microwave for 1 minute, add about 1 tablespoon SF Torani Vanilla Syrup and froth using my Aerolatte thingie. Then I add the coffee to the milk and stir gentle. It\\'s as good as anything I can get at Starbucks!',\n",

I will try this coffee at the larger 9.25 mug size and report back.<br /><br />I brewed a cup at the larger 9.25oz lever and still no real desirable cinnamon flavor.

       " 'I really enjoy coffee, and I have ever since my teenage years. My tastes have gradually evolved and escalated. The first to go was any kind of instant coffee. How anyone could drink that swill is beyond me. Next to go was any kind of additive, such as cream or sugar. The next to go was any kind of ground coffee in a can. Some is marginally OK, but compared to whole-bean coffee, it just doesn\\'t cut it. No, whole-bean coffee without any additives and ground on the spot is the only coffee I\\'ll drink, short of some kind of emergency.<br /><br />When It comes to whole-bean coffees, there\\'s quite an amazing variety. I found Trader Joe\\'s to have an excellent selection from all over the world, and the cost (on a per pound basis) was typically about 50% that of what you might expect to pay in the local super market. I particularly liked their Columbian Supremo. The problem is, the local Trader Joe\"s is a long way off and I sometimes run out between visits. Well, I\\'ve then picked up some large bags of beans, one of which was Starbucks French Roast, at my local Costco store and it was quite excellent. Starbucks is first rate, but tends to be somewhat pricey, even when purchased at Costco.<br /><br />Well, one day I discovered the Kirkland Signature House Blend bags of whole-bean coffee at Costco. In my opinion, Kirkland Signature products have always been of the highest quality but at a substantially reduced price. For example, this Kirkland coffee is almost half the cost (on a per pound basis) of Starbucks French Roast. But, right on the front of the Kirkland package it says \"Roasted by Starbucks Coffee Co.\" Hmmmm. I just had to try this one. Well, it\\'s excellent. It\\'s a little less robust than my Starbucks French Roast, but I prefer it that way. I\\'d say it\\'s first rate coffee at a bargain basement price. Buying whole-bean coffee at the local supermarket is now out of the question.<br /><br />Gary Peterson',\n",

I thought I\\'d expand my Lavazza palate a bit and try the Tierra and so I confidently ordered the 3 can pack, but as I\\'m beginning can #2, I\\'m finding myself simply waiting out the use of cans 2 and 3 so I can go back to my regular Crema.<br /><br />The Tierra is not bad coffee - not by a long shot. It\\'s smooth and... the word I keep thinking of is \"light\", especially if you\\'re used to drinking a darker, richer roast.  It has that slight lemon aftertaste on my tongue that Columbian coffee has, and I don\\'t like that at all so I add flavored creamer to disguise that after taste rather than my normal warmed regular cream . And once the flavored creamer is added, it disguises the good as well as the bad flavors so I\\'m left feeling like I\\'m missing out on the coffeeness of my coffee.  Also, I find myself using nearly twice as much ground coffee to make a pot as I use of the Crema or Qualita Rossa, so the cans themselves will only last half as long.<br /><br />Having said all that, I\\'m giving it four stars because my parents are visiting and this morning I made them the Tierra for breakfast and they really loved it.  They both prefer a lighter roast and usually cream the heck out of their coffee at my house to dilute it down a bit.  The Tierra they found delicious.  So I\\'m giving it 4 stars to differentiate it from my favorite Lavazzas (which are 5s!) but also to acknowledge that this is probably really good coffee for those who enjoy a lighter roast.',\n",

When I opened the first tin I was concerned because it was such a light roast.  This is not at all what I would call a robust coffee.  This is more in line with Dunkin' Donuts or a Deli cup of coffee.  If you are a fan of Starbuck's or Seattle's Best roasts this will be a let down.  I wound up mixing the coffee with a darker roast in an attempt to make it more palitable.  Now I have two cans left that I don't want.<br /><br />I'm not saying that this is awful coffee, but it's not for me and may not be for you if you're used to darker roasts and stronger coffee.

When used as cappuccino in a dedicated cappuccino maker, this brand can't be beat.<br /><br />Right away a cup of this coffee reminded me of a few gourmet brands I've tried lately.  It reminds me of a rich Colombian; not too weak and not too bold and worthy of daily enjoyment.  The coffee is not bitter.<br /><br />These beans are a fine grind with a golden brown hue.  Regular drip brewers may find the grind too fine.  It worked well in my espresso maker and makes a tasty cappuccino.  Don't let the light hue trick you into thinking this is weak coffee.  It is not!  When brewed correctly, it is a wonderful blend.<br />I downloaded a photo of the coffee grounds. One can see the golden-brown hue of the beans and the fine grind.<br /><br />Edit 11 Jan 11:  Apparently this brand isn't a big seller at Amazon and the company has a surplus of this in its warehouses.  Amazon has been offering this brand during its Friday sales, sometimes as low as $8.80 for a three-pack.  There is a reason for this:  the last four packages of this coffee have had an expiration date of 30 May 2011.  It's no big deal to me as I use three cans a month on average and will run out of my stock by May, but for someone who may only occassionally brew a pot of gourmet coffee, this may be a concern.  Coffee will remain drinkable months after its expiration date if kept sealed and/or in a dark, cool storage place, but it can not be sold.<br /><br />Edit 12 May 11:  The price has dropped back down to $14.99.  I gave the rating a star back.  I still have quite a few cans from my splurge purchase last fall.  The coffee still tastes great.  Apparently this coffee's price keeps fluctuating so buyer beware:  at $15 or less this coffee is a great deal, but at a higher price you may be better off going elsewhere.<br /><br />Edit 3 Nov 2011:  Holy Coffeebean, the price is now past the mid USD 20s!!!

       " 'This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can\\'t find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you\\'re curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it\\'s compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I\\'d like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they\\'re reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it\\'s very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it\\'s capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn\\'t be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own \"stand\" in order to fill it properly.',\n",

I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the \"old fashion way\" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don\\'t feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won\\'t be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse.

       " 'When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn\\'t much better. Third time\\'s a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you\\'ll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16\" thick, 5/32\" inside diameter, and 3/8\" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493.',\n",
       " \"At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.  Good coarse grind, check.  No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.  I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail!<br />We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean.  We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.<br />Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug.\",\n",
       " \"Just got the Ekobrew today and tried it out. I have been a Solofill fan since they came out but the Ekobrew design seems to beat the Solofill. First off, the flat bottom makes it easy to fill. I usually run two cycles for a larger cup of coffee. With the Ekobrew the lid stays shut and doesn't leak water at the top. I was surprised how easily the grounds came out and just a quick rinse and it was ready to go again. Seems to be the best choice around for avoiding the high cost of K cups.\",\n",
       " \"WOW - we got our keurig as a gift and with the gift was a big box of the k-cups with all the eh, average tasting coffees...but once those ran out we would never be the people to spend that much money on coffee every month. so we have been using the solofil for about 8 months. we hated it and because of it, hated the keurig. the coffee we buy (the strongest roast from starbucks) was always watery and the solofil would leak all the time and it was such a pain to clean. but we put up with it. ENTER the ekobrew! omg this thing is amazing. i don't know what makes it so much different and i don't care -i just care that we get an amazing cup of coffee from our machine now!

       " \"My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys.\",\n",
       " \"With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time.  Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!\",\n",

Nice balanced flavors, with a natural mild sweetness, like the best coffee has. Not acidic, not bitter, but strong and interesting. Wakes up my brain and tongue, just as I'd hoped.

I don\\'t like most flavored coffee, so I didn\\'t like flavored Teeccino any better, but that is no slam against Teeccino in particular since some people love something like Amaretto in a hot drink.

The 5 I have tried are the raspberry truffle of course and Creme Caramel (tastes like those little square caramels you see at Halloween), Spicy Mayan ( My favorite chocolate and cinnamon mix), pecan praline and creme brulee. I am so happy I no longer have to spend more to stock these coffees. My house is never out of the Raspberry Chocolate truffle and the Spicy Mayan. They have the best and most unique flavors. If you like flavored coffee that is full of flavor and yet has a nice smooth medium bodied coffee taste, then these are a must try. I highly recommend the Van Houtte line of k cups.',\n",

I have been spending more just to get these flavors and now I just hope Amazon adds some of them to the subscribe and save program. Creme Brulee tastes just like having a Creme Brulee with a nice cup of coffee. I am impressed with how these k cups taste exactly like the name. This coffee is not over whelmingly sweet and has just a hint of flavor. It is a medium bodied, smooth coffee. If you like Creme Brulee and you like coffee, you have to try this. You will not be disapointed.',\n",
       " 'My husband gave me a Keurig coffee maker, so we\\'ve been trying different flavors of coffee.  To me, I don\\'t care about brand necessarily, I just like flavored coffee.  On the top of my list are Gloria Jean\\'s assorted flavors (Hazelnut, French Vanilla, White Chocolate -- I think).  That one also includes a Mudslide flavor, but we thought it had a slight coconut taste we didn\\'t care for.  I like the Kahlua brand Kahlua coffee, but the flavor portion is a little strong. But my VERY, VERY, VERY favorite flavor is this Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle flavor.  It\\'s just the right balance of \"coffee\" to \"flavor\" ratio.  You can taste it, but still taste the coffee.  And my kitchen smells heavenly!  But a lot of it boils down to personal taste and preferences.  If you typically like this type of flavored coffee, you will love this flavor.  And I definitely recommend Subscribe and Save for K-cups if you have a Keurig.

But, I first bought Cafix packaged in a glass jar and having a granular consistency. LOVED it! This Cafix is packaged in canisters and is a powder. It tastes different. Not bad. Just different. To me it has a very nutty taste. I like the glass jar Cafix better, but I can also drink the canister kind. Some people, however, might not like the nuttier taste. Just FYI.\",\n",
       " \"I recently gave up coffee and decided to try three different coffee substitutes: Roastaroma, Cafix, and Pero. Although Cafix tasted the most like real coffee (and it tastes *a lot* like real coffee), and all three products are pretty good, Roastaroma was my favorite.<br /><br />It is very similar to coffee, but it doesn't quite have the bitter bite of coffee. Those of you who are looking for that slight bitterness might prefer Cafix. Roastaroma actually reminds me a little bit of Mexican hot chocolate--the cinnamon and carob flavors come through pretty strongly in the drink, giving it a cinnamon-chocolatey flavor. I used to drink coffee to satisfy my sweet tooth on low calories. This drink totally fits the bill for this purpose.<br /><br />The Pero is pretty good, too. Like Roastaroma, it doesn't have the bitter coffee taste, but it still makes for a decent imitation of decaf. I like to drink it with cinnamon-flavored powdered creamer. Pero's a good value, too: it's strong enough that you don't need to use very much to flavor your whole drink. I drink the Pero when I'm trying to ration the Roastaroma out to myself so as not to run out.<br /><br />So Roastaroma has the best flavor, Cafix tastes the most like coffee, and Pero is a good back-up.<br /><br />A quick note on Postum: I do not care for it. I find that people who like Postum tend to be people who were never coffee drinkers. It tastes nothing like coffee. If you try Postum as a coffee substitute, you will be disappointed.\",\n",

Is that possible?  I doubt it.  Anyway, I swear this stuff tastes more like coffee every time I drink it.  I have been tempted to play a practical joke with people at work by asking them to try my new \"coffee\".  I\\'ll bet I could fool many of them.

We have not been disappointed.  We like it better than coffee.  It is smooth with no bitterness.  It mixes well with hot chocolate and tastes good straight and black if that's what you want.

I think it tastes fine; it's alot better than the office sludge at my company.  I like instant coffee because it's portable and only requires hot water.  I have a water cooler at home and can brew up a cup in two seconds.  Plus I don't have to make 4 cups of coffee just to drink 1 cup (you know you can't brew small batches in those coffeemakers!)<br /><br />I only drink decaf and it's actually kinda hard to find decaf in any form... certain coffeehouses stop brewing it after 12pm, which means an afternoon cup for me has to come from somewhere else.  That's why I picked up these to have on my desk at work.  It's my second cup of coffee for the day AND it prevents me from dolling out $2 every time I need a cup of coffee.  I use 3 packets per 20 oz of hot water since I like my coffee strong.  It averages to $.60/cup.<br /><br />It's not going to completely replace my coffee habit, but it's a good way to have a decent budget and works in a pinch.  It almost never goes bad-- the expiry on my box says 11.6.17 (which is either in two years or 8 years depending how u read the date) so you don't have to worry about it spoiling or oxidizing.

After brewing this in my office, I was trying to find lysol or air freshner to clear the air.  I feel I need to run vinegar through machine to clear any trace of this bad coffee.

       " \"Though this is my first K-Cup review, Let me establish my position and reasons I came to this conclusion. First, I am coffee wimp. I drink coffee only with half & half (fat free) and imitation sugar. Second, my B40 has not yet arrived so I used my Krups model 871 Espresso machine to brew my K-cup which, is not all that different than the brewing process of the Keurig machines. Third, I gave up drinking all drinks made up or including alcohol in 1988 due to health reasons but prior to that time I had drank White Russians and was very fond of them I just can't remember exactly what Kahlua tasted like except it was sweet and I enjoyed them. Forth, Wither one likes or dislikes one K-cup over another is purely subjective and I'm not criticizing those who wrote negative review. With that established, lets move on.<br /><br />When I opened the Kahlua K-cup I noticed a distinct sweet aroma and also a dark roasted bean odor like one might experienced from a Starbucks coffee; so being from Seattle Washington I'm use to that.<br /><br />I pealed off the lid of the K-cup and emptied it into the Krups filter basket. Tampered it down sightly like one would do for an espresso grind, measured about 8 ounces of water and poured that into the machine and then turned it on.<br /><br />When the coffee started to drip into the carafe and some steam arose I wasn't sure wither to hold my breath or hold my nose. Much to my surprise I did notice an odor like from a dark roasted bean or from my espresso's I use to make, but nothing offensive. I was a bit perplexed; again I thought of the reviewers who had complained of an offensive odor emitting from their machines during the brewing process.<br /><br />Upon completion of the brewing cycle, I poured the coffee in my large mug added the Half & Half until it reached a blond- Carmel like color (but not enough to over power the coffee) and the sweetener and took my first sip, with great anticipation. Not bad was my first impression. I actually enjoyed it. It had a sweet but not to sweet flavor and to my mind, a Carmel like flavor with a medium-dark roasted base of a regular coffee. No offensive taste or aroma others had written about and a pleasant after taste that lingered for some time after wards, not to strong nor acidic quite pleasant actually.<br /><br />My conclusion? Perhaps the other reviewers had a bad batch or this particular flavor needs to be consumed with some cream or cream like dairy product and or a sweetener. Either way, I plan to continue on drinking this K-cup flavor for some time and can't wait till tomorrow to have my next cup.<br /><br />When my B40 arrives and I have a different result with that machine I will add an update.\",\n",

I\\'d say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile. The new packaging is OK (you get 2 extra K-Cups for the $$) as long as you have the room in your kitchen to store the larger single box....as opposed to storing the two 24 cartridge boxes.<br /><br />NOTE: The description of this coffee uses the words \"Medium Extra Bold\" in it\\'s packaging as opposed to the two 24 boxes version which lead me to think there was now two DIFFERENT varieties of this Donut Shop coffee....so I ordered both (wanted 98/100 anyway) but it turns out that both were the same.

       " 'First you must know I am one who roasts my own green beans at home, including Sumatran, but also many African varieties. I like a STRONG cup of coffee. I use K-cups at work because we have no facility for rinsing/cleaning/getting water for a regular machine.<br /><br />Sumatran coffees generally have a very rich, earthy taste; some would describe it as being \"tangy\" almost. Having tried the two other main brands of Sumatran for K-cups, the Puck is by far the best. It is not as bold as something you would get from Starbucks or from roasting yourself, but it has all the flavor elements of a good Sumatran cup. It especially has that nice earthy taste. Even the aftertaste is rich.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: If you are looking for a k-cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting, this coffee is not for you. In my opinion you get a Sumatran because you love strong coffee. Watered down it loses its distinctiveness. Get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor. I make mine with 2 k-cups, at the smallest setting. By camparison, I would give a Starbucks Sumatra mandheling a 10/10 rating for boldness. The Puck is about an 8, the Diedrich is a 4.<br />I highly recommend this coffee for bold coffee lovers, provided you use the smallest cup setting. You will not be disappointed. Best K-cup I have had yet, and I have tried many- Newman, Timothy\\'s, Donut Shop, Diedrich, etc.<br /><br />Addendum: I have since tried th Green Mountain Sumatran, and gave that a one -star.

When she received her Keuring machine she started to experiment with other brands and blends.  She occasionally drinks a flavored coffee but this has become her favorite.  I get her a couple of boxes a month and she loves it.  I have tried it and here is my take on this blend:<br /><br />The body (or \"mouth-feel\") is light to medium.  The acidity is medium-low so it won\\'t have too much of a bite, especially of you use cream.  The flavor is surprisingly complex with some spice (maybe cardamom or anise and a little pepper) as well as a rich coffee finish.  This will not replace my favorite dark roasts but I will keep it on hand for those guests who find a \"Starbucks-type\" of coffee too strong or bitter.

I especially enjoy Timothy's brand of Hazelnut decaf over Gloria Jean's version. Timothy's seems to have a richer, fuller and a bit smoother taste over Gloria Jean's.

Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii.  It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee.

I bought 3 sets for one dollar (15,000 dong) in Vietnam, and soon realized that I needed more. So, I bought a few in the U.S. (local VN grocery store) and noticed that they come in different forms. This one has the screw in press, which I don\\'t like as much as the simple press down piece that just sits on top of the ground coffee. It works great. The screw in needs to be tighten until you hit the coffee, but don\\'t tighten too much (low drip, or no drip) and too little (too fast), but just right. I can\\'t figure it out.<br /><br />It is much more difficult to remove the screw part after the coffee is done. Worse, sometimes it can be that it is screwed in too hard, so the water does not drain through, but now you can\\'t loosen it, because the hot water covers the piece. That\\'s why the simpler version works much better.

The substitution I make is that, because I do not have an espresso maker, I use strong coffee.  I put in maybe a cup of coffee, and subtract some from the milk so it doesn't end up having too much liquid.<br /><br />The downside of this product is the trans and saturated fat.  I had no idea this things were so bad for me!<br /><br />Another approach to making frappes, without the saturated fat, is to mix hot coffee with chocolate pudding mix (not instant -- it has a terrible off taste!), then blend it up with some ice and milk.

If you don\\'t like that \\'in your face\\' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you. It\\'s not bitter, a bit floral, with a true pure coffee taste. Does it match Dunkin Donuts style coffee in taste? I\\'d say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile.

When I first tried this I was not expecting much, it sounds bland, plain, everyday type of coffee.  Don't get me wrong, I have had some pretty good cups of coffee in donut shops but nothing to write home about.  When I took my first sip, I thought wow, this is amazing.  Smooth, not much of an acid taste, about as close to perfect as I could describe.  My love for this k-cup continued and continues to this day.  Many times you find a k-cup which at first is very good, but after a couple of cups you get a little sick of them; not with this one.  It has been and continues to be my absolute favorite.

Sure enough, when you go to lift the K-cup out of the Keurig for disposal, you will find it is very heavy compared to others.

It is the perfect crowd pleasing blend for any time of day or night.<br /><br />I have shopped all over and you can\\'t beat the variety or the price here on Amazon when you join their club.  A great value.<br /><br />I do wish that Amazon would change the name by removing \"Extra Bold\".  It is not.  It is, at most, a medium roast.

Worse, about 20% of the K-Cups no longer have the full amount of coffee in them.  Additionally, I am not sure that these loose grounds won't impact the Keurig.

I can still purchase anything I want at cost (if I drive the 30 miles to pick it up).  I choose to use Amazon's subscription for ease of use.  It is only a couple of bucks more than cost, and includes free shipping.  No more trips for coffee, and sure I miss the old mates, but this so worth it.<br /><br />The coffee is smooth and strong.  I prefer a very strong cup of Joe.  I typically make Americanos from my espresso machine (a 3 oz double shot diluted w/ 5 oz water).  That is close to what this tastes like.  I don't know about its acidity, but I can say that it is in line with my palate.  No bitterness (like one famous brand).  No creama, but really, what do you expect.  This is not espresso, it is a strong brew made from Arabica.  Really, just a quick quality cup of coffee.<br /><br />I also order the decaf.  It is just as good\",\n",

Unfortunately, while the flavor is still my favorite, I've had terrible luck with the K-Cups themselves.  Every second or third cup I brew leaves loads of coffee grounds in the cup.  I've had this happen on occasion with other K-Cups over the two years I've owned my Keurig, but NEVER to this extent.  I don't know if the foil cap is the cause of the problem or what, but it appears that every time the pin punctures the K-Cup it leaves a much larger than normal hole that causes the grounds to end up in the coffee.  At first I thought maybe it was a problem with my brewer, but I've used 4 other varieties since the problem began and I've had zero issues with those.

By that I mean that I would get a french vanilla and a french vanilla decaf.  So, there were at least 5 flavors that I got with a decaf of the same flavor.  My biggest issue with these is the expiration dates.  My K-Cups had expiration dates ranging from 3 months ago to 1/2013.  In fact, my batch had 5 expired K-Cups.  The expiration dates for them were early February, so that's not even close to being good.  I wasn't too happy to find that 10% of my order was expired.  Perhaps this is just a fluke or perhaps I'm the only one who wrote a review that checked the expiration dates on every single K-Cup received.

I\\'ve given up my Mr. Coffee and now have a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6\">Keurig Home Brewing System</a> and I make my coffee a cup at a time and I really love it. It only takes a minute to make a cup and each cup is different, depending on my mood.<br /><br />I\\'ve been drinking K-cup coffee for a couple years now and have more of these little cups in my house than you can shake a stick at. For awhile I used a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JD3C9E\">Chrome Carosel</a>, made by Keurig, but I had to keep filling it and also it was kind of clumsy for me. Besides, my coffee affliction is way to huge to be held down to a little spinning coffee merry-go-round.<br /><br />For the first few months my coffee problem went spinning out of control. I had boxes and boxes of coffee in my pantry, refrigerator, cupboards, garage, even in the trunk of my car, but now I\\'ve sort of got my gourmet coffee disorder in hand and down to twenty-eight flavors.<br /><br />For Breakfast I have my favorite seven and they are: Timothy\\'s World Coffee, Extra Bold Fair Trade Nicaraguan, Timothy\\'s World Coffee, Midnight Magic, Bold, Timothy\\'s World Coffee, Kona Blend, Tully\\'s French Roast Coffee K-Cups, Coffee People Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast, Timothy\\'s World Coffee, Morning Blend and Coffee People Coffee, Wake Up Call Bold.<br /><br />For Lunch I have my favorite seven and they are: Gloria Jean\\'s Coffees Hazelnut Coffee, Emeril\\'s K-cups, Big Easy Bold, Gloria Jean\\'s Coffees, Black Gold Extra Bold, Timothy\\'s World Coffee, Private Blend, Timothy\\'s World Coffee, Extra Bold Parisian Nights, Timothy\\'s World Coffee, Colombian La Vereda and Gloria Jean\\'s Coffees GJ Special Blend<br /><br />And for dinner, yes I drink coffee in the evening as well, but that\\'s not so bad, considering I don\\'t drink alcohol, don\\'t smoke, don\\'t eat sweets and eat very little meat. Sometimes I\\'ll eat meat, but not often, so a cup of coffee with dinner doesn\\'t seem so bad, considering. If it kept me up at night, well then that would be different, but it doesn\\'t.<br /><br />Anyway for dinner I\\'ll drink one of these seven: Tully\\'s Full City Roast Coffee, Gloria Jean\\'s Coffee, Mudslide, Timothy\\'s World Coffee, Italian Blend, Green Mountain Coffee K-Cups Dark Magic Extra Bold, Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, Timothy\\'s World Coffee, San Lorenzo Dark and Gloria Jean\\'s Coffee, Classic Reserve.<br /><br />And then there is my absolute favorite, number twenty-two and that is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZH8NA\">Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso</a>, a Timothy\\'s World Coffee.<br /><br />I keep my k-cups in three large assorted tupperware tubs, marked in red sharpie, of course, Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. So when I reach into the breakfast tub for example, I never know which of the seven flavors that I\\'m going to wind up with. I don\\'t drink coffee during my meal, but afterwards, instead of desert. It\\'s a quiet time for me. I think and reflect over my coffee as I delight in each and every sip. I know for some, having twenty-two different flavors of coffee in my kitchen might seem a bit much, maybe even a bit quirky, well everyone\\'s gotta have their quirks, besides, I\\'ve cut way down.<br /><br />Now, about that twenty-second flavor. When I absolutely have to have an extra cup during that quiet, coffee drinking them, then that\\'s the flavor I go for. How often does that happen, when one cup isn\\'t enough? Only about once a day. Still, from two pots a java a day, down to four cups, is a pretty good thing, I\\'m not as wired as I used to be, but let\\'s face it, I\\'m still running on coffee. That\\'s not so bad though, better a coffee crutch than something else.<br /><br />In my opinion these are the twenty-two best cups of joy in the whole wide world. At least the best twenty-two flavors I\\'ve come across in the hundreds I\\'ve tried. But please don\\'t take my word as gospel, everybody\\'s different. You have to dive right right in, take a chance, try several flavors till you find the one or the twenty-two that you like best.',\n",

Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril\\'s.<br /><br />There is no question here.

We don\\'t want to buy Espresso Doubleshots from the grocery because, even the light version has calories and fat (plus disgusting Sucralose - Splenda). \"illy issimo Caffe - No sugar\" is exactly what is says it is. a 6.8 oz can of brewed Espresso with no artificial sweetners, no milk, no cream, nothing. It has 15 calories per can...thats because Coffee beans do have oil on them and contain some calories.  Each can has around 150mg Caffiene (I cannot recall). That is 150 mg in 6.8 oz of espresso. Basically, just over the caffiene amount of a dopio (double) espresso from a major coffee chain.  I can add my own non-fat milk and be set, add some cold water and ice if I want...even add some PureVia or Truvia (Stevia Type Zero Calorie Sweetener) which is all natural and much better for you (with no after taste). I can add whatever I want. I basically can put into my body, exactly what I want to; let\\'s not forget the convenience factor of grabbing a can, as you run out the door, and downing it in the car. Best thing I\\'ve ever found on Amazon!!!  Life is now complete...I don\\'t even have to leave the house to get good iced espresso.  By the way...the drink I normally get at \"The Bux\" is about $3.45. A 12-pack on here is $25.00 currently.  If I drink 1 a day, for 36 days - That would cost $75.00. If I go to my favorite coffee house for 36 days - It would cost around $125.00. I don\\'t think there is a question as to cheaper, more convenient, and better.',\n",

The packaging is otherwise nearly identical to the standard VIAs, so you\\'ll have to look closely to notice it.<br /><br />Mocha VIA dissolves quickly, much the same way as the original VIAs, but with a slightly milky hue. The mocha-coffee aroma is present, but the actual flavor of the coffee differs notably from the smell; both the coffee and mocha components are low-grade, with the sugar element coming in quite strong (\"lightly sweetened\" means the same thing here as it does with Iced VIA - almost as sweet as soda.) The overall impression is office-quality bitter coffee with some condiment chocolate powder thrown in and a remarkably heaping spoon of sugar.<br /><br />This does not mean that Mocha VIA is useless; part of what made the original VIAs so popular was how many different ways they could be used in mixed drinks (VIA dissolves in cold water/milk/etc as well as hot), and I would wager that over time, there will be a sizable list of unique mix recipes for these flavored varieties as well.

One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can\\'t find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you\\'re curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it\\'s compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I\\'d like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they\\'re reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it\\'s very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it\\'s capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn\\'t be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own \"stand\" in order to fill it properly.',\n",

I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the \"old fashion way\" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don\\'t feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it.

       " 'When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn\\'t much better. Third time\\'s a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you\\'ll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16\" thick, 5/32\" inside diameter, and 3/8\" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493.',\n",

No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.  I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail!<br />We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean.  We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.<br />Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug.\",\n",

First off, the flat bottom makes it easy to fill. I usually run two cycles for a larger cup of coffee. With the Ekobrew the lid stays shut and doesn't leak water at the top. I was surprised how easily the grounds came out and just a quick rinse and it was ready to go again. Seems to be the best choice around for avoiding the high cost of K cups.\",\n",

ENTER the ekobrew! omg this thing is amazing. i don't know what makes it so much different and i don't care -i just care that we get an amazing cup of coffee from our machine now!

The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys.\",\n",

Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!\",\n",

I liked that it was organic, and there\\'s nothing in the ingredients that turned me off.  I really didn\\'t expect it to be anything like coffee (they never are), but I thought it might be good in its own way.<br /><br />When the sample showed up, I ran a cup through my old drip-cone, and it was just ok.  A little watered down - I think I didn\\'t use enough for the big mugful of water.  The funny thing though, was that it tasted like watered down coffee.  Just the way coffee used to taste when I didn\\'t use enough for the amount of water.<br /><br />Second cup I used two big spoonfuls directly in the water and boiled it for 5 minutes.  After a minute or two, it started to smell like... well, coffee.  When poured, it had the same dark brown color and opaqueness I remember, and suddenly I was holding a cup of coffee.  I drank it black.  It was a passable cup - very satisfying - I actually stood there and gulped it down in the kitchen.<br /><br />It\\'s smoother than I remember coffee being, less \"bite\" - probably because it doesn\\'t have the same acids and oils that coffee does - but it does have a comparable taste and richness.  I never really liked flavored coffees, but the vanilla is very light - more a scent than a taste - and doesn\\'t bother me at all.<br /><br />In fact, if you\\'d handed me a cup of this when I could still drink coffee, I might have looked at it sideways and asked where you found such a smooth roast, but I wouldn\\'t have questioned that it WAS coffee.<br /><br />That\\'s pretty impressive - kudos to whoever developed this stuff.  Don\\'t know how they did it, but I\\'ll keep on drinking it.  I also look forward to giving it to some coffee drinking friends and waiting until after they drink it to mention that it isn\\'t coffee =o)',\n",

       " 'I\\'ve been a fan of the original Starbucks VIA Colombian since its release, and had been keeping a close eye on my local retailer for the flavored varieties to be released, which they have inexplicably stocked roughly two weeks before the release date.<br /><br />The notably larger and heavier packages are sold alongside the original VIAs, featuring only six servings per pack. VIA fans will note the \"lightly sweetened\" remark on the front of the box, along with the addition of cane sugar in the ingredients list. The packaging is otherwise nearly identical to the standard VIAs, so you\\'ll have to look closely to notice it.<br /><br />Mocha VIA dissolves quickly, much the same way as the original VIAs, but with a slightly milky hue. The mocha-coffee aroma is present, but the actual flavor of the coffee differs notably from the smell; both the coffee and mocha components are low-grade, with the sugar element coming in quite strong (\"lightly sweetened\" means the same thing here as it does with Iced VIA - almost as sweet as soda.) The overall impression is office-quality bitter coffee with some condiment chocolate powder thrown in and a remarkably heaping spoon of sugar.<br /><br />This does not mean that Mocha VIA is useless; part of what made the original VIAs so popular was how many different ways they could be used in mixed drinks (VIA dissolves in cold water/milk/etc as well as hot), and I would wager that over time, there will be a sizable list of unique mix recipes for these flavored varieties as well. But without those recipes, most Starbucks fans who expect a rather complex quality blended coffee drink will be disappointed by trying to drink this straight.',\n",

Don\\'t let the words dark and extra bold scare you off - this coffee is rich, smooth and in many ways mellow.

This coffee brewed up strong, but had a bit of an empty, bitter finish.  The caffeine content is acceptable.  The package could have been treated a little better during shipping as there were lots of dents, crushed corners and sides, and evidence of bending on the sides of the k-cups.  None of the cups have thus far shown a broken seal though.<br /><br />Overall this is an acceptable extra bold style k-cup, but there are better options out there.  My favorites have been the Newman's Own and the Sumatran Reserve.  I haven't tried the Black Diamond K-cups as they are a bit pricey right now also.  I'll probably end up using a coupon and buying my preferred flavors in a brick and mortar store nearby for a better price, or ordering some Coffee People 50-count extra bold flavors.  Their boxes have had pretty stable pricing for the past 6 months or so.<br /><br />If you are out of options, this is a cheaper substitute for a pricier extra bold flavor.  I wish Amazon could sort out their supply issues and keep K-cup prices a little more stable.

       " 'This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can\\'t find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you\\'re curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it\\'s compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I\\'d like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they\\'re reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it\\'s very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it\\'s capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn\\'t be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own \"stand\" in order to fill it properly.',\n",
       " 'Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don\\'t love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the \"old fashion way\" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don\\'t feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won\\'t be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew!',\n",
       " 'When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn\\'t much better. Third time\\'s a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you\\'ll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16\" thick, 5/32\" inside diameter, and 3/8\" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493.',\n",
       " \"At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.  Good coarse grind, check.  No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.  I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail!<br />We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean.  We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.<br />Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug.\",\n",
       " \"Just got the Ekobrew today and tried it out. I have been a Solofill fan since they came out but the Ekobrew design seems to beat the Solofill. First off, the flat bottom makes it easy to fill. I usually run two cycles for a larger cup of coffee. With the Ekobrew the lid stays shut and doesn't leak water at the top. I was surprised how easily the grounds came out and just a quick rinse and it was ready to go again. Seems to be the best choice around for avoiding the high cost of K cups.\",\n",
       " \"WOW - we got our keurig as a gift and with the gift was a big box of the k-cups with all the eh, average tasting coffees...but once those ran out we would never be the people to spend that much money on coffee every month. so we have been using the solofil for about 8 months. we hated it and because of it, hated the keurig. the coffee we buy (the strongest roast from starbucks) was always watery and the solofil would leak all the time and it was such a pain to clean. but we put up with it. ENTER the ekobrew! omg this thing is amazing. i don't know what makes it so much different and i don't care -i just care that we get an amazing cup of coffee from our machine now!  SUCH  a difference. we used to use the solofil twice for one cup of coffee - we would make two of the smallest cups to make it as strong as possible. not anymore!! highly recommend! buying 2 more!\",\n",
       " \"My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys.\",\n",
       " \"With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time.  Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!\",\n",

If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I\\'d like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they\\'re reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it\\'s very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it\\'s capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn\\'t be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own \"stand\" in order to fill it properly.',\n",
       " 'Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don\\'t love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the \"old fashion way\" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don\\'t feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won\\'t be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew!',\n",
       " 'When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn\\'t much better. Third time\\'s a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you\\'ll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16\" thick, 5/32\" inside diameter, and 3/8\" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493.',\n",
       " \"At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.  Good coarse grind, check.  No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.  I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail!<br />We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean.  We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.<br />Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug.\",\n",
       " \"Just got the Ekobrew today and tried it out. I have been a Solofill fan since they came out but the Ekobrew design seems to beat the Solofill. First off, the flat bottom makes it easy to fill. I usually run two cycles for a larger cup of coffee. With the Ekobrew the lid stays shut and doesn't leak water at the top. I was surprised how easily the grounds came out and just a quick rinse and it was ready to go again. Seems to be the best choice around for avoiding the high cost of K cups.\",\n",
       " \"WOW - we got our keurig as a gift and with the gift was a big box of the k-cups with all the eh, average tasting coffees...but once those ran out we would never be the people to spend that much money on coffee every month. so we have been using the solofil for about 8 months. we hated it and because of it, hated the keurig. the coffee we buy (the strongest roast from starbucks) was always watery and the solofil would leak all the time and it was such a pain to clean. but we put up with it. ENTER the ekobrew! omg this thing is amazing. i don't know what makes it so much different and i don't care -i just care that we get an amazing cup of coffee from our machine now!  SUCH  a difference. we used to use the solofil twice for one cup of coffee - we would make two of the smallest cups to make it as strong as possible. not anymore!! highly recommend! buying 2 more!\",\n",
       " \"My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys.\",\n",
       " \"With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time.  Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!\",\n",
       " 'After FINALLY purchasing <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA\">the best coffee maker</a> I\\'ve ever had in 40 years of drinking coffee, the hunt was on to find the best tasting coffee to go with it. When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it\\'s really a \"to each his or her own\" thing. But I\\'ve tried \\'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril\\'s Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril\\'s Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they\\'re bold. I\\'ve tried the \"Midnight Magic\" brand; I\\'ve tried the \"Jet Fuel\" brand; I\\'ve tried the \"Donut Shop\" brand; I\\'ve tried all of the \"Extra Bolds\"; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril\\'s Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What\\'s really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril\\'s Big Easy Bold, you won\\'t lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril\\'s.<br /><br />There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that\\'s full of flavor and packs a punch, you\\'ve found the right page here at Amazon. Wake up people, and add this to your cart. Bam!',\n",
       " \"We like our coffee dark and this one handles the job. Even when using the 12oz. setting on the coffee maker, this stuff is thick. If you like strong coffee, you can't go wrong with this one.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve had my Keurig for almost a year and have not been happy with the wimpy strength of the K-cups.  Emeril\\'s  \"Big Easy Bold\" delivers a good strong cup of coffee.  Hooray!!',\n",
       " 'Don\\'t mean to be the one who rains on the bandwagon (pardon the metaphor crash), but, while it is definitely true what other reviewers have written -- that the coffee is very strong, very thick, and very dark (add in an acid level commensurate with the sludge-factor) -- I don\\'t find the taste all that strong, and taste is important.<br /><br />True, these K-Cups will provide a pleasant-tasting beverage the consistency and color of Louisiana mud, but for taste, one can do a lot better.<br /><br />Just for kicks, I had K-cups of coffee back-to-back today, one of this type and one of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X1CC02\">Keurig K-Cup \"Mini-Brewers\" Newman\\'s Own Organics Extra Bold</a>, which is, unfortunately, sold out at the moment.  True, Newman\\'s (RIP) is hardly as dark a roast or as thick a beverage, but the flavor punches through very robustly and is totally superior in the area that counts the most to me -- taste.  It\\'s a lot \"Bold\"er than this brand.<br /><br />One of my favorite dark roasts is the Coffee People line, even of decafs, which truly bury the \"Big Easy Bold\" in the taste department, too, even if one drinks the decaf.  Diedrich coffees come to mind as well as clear winners.<br /><br />Maybe I\\'m spoiled, but I tend to use fewer of the ready-mixed K-Cups brand coffees than employing the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI\">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a> and selecting my own brand and grind.  My current favorite brand of coffee comes from a pair of small roasting houses in Washington state and Alaska.  I keep a couple days\\' worth ground and ready to put into the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI\">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a>s, and there are few pre-packed ground K-Cups that can come anywhere close to the richness of the flavors and choices available if one \"rolls one\\'s own.\"<br /><br />I\\'ve got nothing against Emeril\\'s, and it\\'s a far superior cup of coffee to anything you\\'ll get in most restaurants.  But, happily, we can best that effort without trying too hard.',\n",

This is the strongest, boldest cup of coffee I have found.  It has almost a burnt flavor that I adore!  When this coffee is brewing the aroma is just about Heaven!!  If you prefer a more mellow blend I don't think you will like Big Easy too much, but personally I don't like the flavored cups which taste diluted to me.  You know you are drinking a strong, flavorful cup of coffee when you pop this in your machine.  It will stand up to cream, and is the perfect wake up beverage.  I love Coffee People French Roast, and Timothy's Rainforest Espresso, but I have to say they now taste almost ordinary to me after having discovered Big Easy Bold.

It is strong enough to keep a good flavor after adding my milk and flavorings.<br /><br />Here is how I do it:<br /><br />1 K-Cup - Emeril\\'s Big Easy Bold<br />3 ounces of milk<br />1 tablespoon of cream<br />1 teaspoon  of sugar<br />optional: flavoring of your choice (cinnamon, caramel, chocolate, syrup etc.)<br /><br />In a microwaveable cup (at least 8 ounces)- warm the milk and cream for 30-45 seconds in the microwave on high.  In a large mug brew the K-Cup on the espresso setting.  Take a battery operated milk frother  like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KZUNK\">Aerolatte Milk Frother, Satin Finish</a> and spin the milk until it is to your liking.  Add the teaspoon of sugar to the milk mixture when you have it almost finished.  Pour the milk into the mug with the coffee - stir just a tiny bit and you are ready to enjoy.<br /><br />If you choose to add the optional flavoring add it to the coffee before combining it with the milk.<br /><br />Enjoy - you will be surprised that it is actually better than you have had in the store.',\n",

I have been using mine for a couple months and love the versatility and the ease of using this Kcup replacement.  Unlike the \"My Kcup\" holder that you can use with most Keurig machines, this little gem pops right in without having to remove the pod holder from the brewer.<br /><br />The Solofill takes about 2 tablespoons of coffee and that\\'s the main appeal of this.  You can use your own ground coffee instead of always having to buy the pricey pre-filled Kcups.  It makes a great cup of coffee and allows users to buy any kind of coffee they please.  Some users have complained about cleaning the Solofill.  I find it easy.  Just tap the cooled coffee grounds on the edge of your trash receptacle and most will fall out.  Then rinse it out and it\\'s ready to go again.  I keep two handy so I can be using one and cleaning the other.  I see this little invention as a great way to save money and have options as to the kinds and types of coffee you want to use.',\n",

I didn't think it was difficult to clean using the spray nozzle on the faucet.  Also, be careful not to use super fine grounds (as suggested on the package).  They will plug up the mesh and result in a half brew of coffee so strong it can not be consumed!  Kirkland 100% Columbian-fine ground works well, however.\",\n",
       " \"I love my keurig coffee maker, don't get me wrong, but I don't love adding all those little plastic cups to the land fill. The Solofill allows me to end the conflict between convenience and my concern for the environment.  I can use any coffee I like, or as I frequently do, I can use a pod.  One of the things about the Keurig I love is the ability to choose daily between varieties of coffee.  Buying a pound of one kind of coffee is boring to me. So I buy locally 1/4 bags and store them in a vented airproof (airscape) container. And I buy pods (frequently on sale so the price is the same as ground beans per cup) and dump the grounds into the Solofill. I use 10 gram pods, more is too much, less is not enough. With pods, the coffee remains fresh because it's nitrogen packed. I don't have to drink all the same kind at once to use it up =)  So i balance between my locally purchased fresh ground and the pods. The Solofill brews a much better cup than the K cups provide. Much richer mouth feel, and slightly stronger than an extra bold k cup.<br />I drink mostly dark roasts (k cups: dark magic, double black diamond) and I'm very satisfied with the cups from a Solofill with 10 grams ground coffee, either from a pod or fresh.  The device self-tamps when you close it so the water flows evenly throughout the grounds. No dry spots. I pop the Keurig open after I brew and come back to dump the grounds after I drink; that gives the solofill time to cool off.  The only caveat is to make sure you flick off any grounds on the rim before you close the solofill so it makes a solid seal. I bought two so I can always have one ready to go......\",\n",

If you can read and follow directions you will have no problem with this.  My K Cup works fine, but the Solofill Cup works better.  Easier to use, better flow, more of the flavors of fresh ground coffee come through.  If you use the right grind, only fill to the fill line, make sure the gasket is clean and snap the lid shut it will work right every time.  Added bonus, when I am in a hurry and snap a factory K Cup in, I don't have to change the filter holder.  Best $15.00 spent in awhile.  Get to use local custom blend fresh whole bean coffee that tastes as good as French Press.  My K Cup coffee always lacked some of the flavor, Solofill Cup does not.\",\n",

       " \"I can't stand aspartame and Splenda because of the chemical aftertaste, but I read good things about stevia and glucose tolerance (search PubMed on NIH's website for stevia), so wanted to give it a try.  I can definitely tell the difference between sugar and Truvia.  It leaves sort of a woody/licorice aftertaste in my mouth, but the taste does not linger as long as the aftertaste from Splenda.  Truvia is not nearly as unpleasant as Splenda, but I think I would prefer tea or coffee unsweetened over sweetened with Truvia.<br /><br />Just to prove that I wasn't being unconsciously biased against Truvia, I asked my husband to brew a pot of coffee, split it equally into two measuring cups, and add 2 teaspoons of sugar to one cup and 1 packet of Truvia to the other.  (In case this seems somewhat arbitrary, Truvia states that 1 packet is equal to about 2 teaspoons of sugar, in sweetness.)  I didn't want down two cups of coffee at once, so I drank several shot glasses of the differently-sweetened coffee.  After several blind taste tests, I could tell which one was Truvia and which one was sugar every time.  Also, the aftertaste seemed to get worse as the coffee cooled.<br /><br />My husband could also tell the difference between Truvia and sugar, but he didn't seem to mind the taste very much.  A friend of ours can't tell the difference between Truvia and sugar at all.  So before you spring for a box (or 6 boxes, on Amazon) of Truvia, as it is fairly expensive compared to Splenda or sugar, you should try a packet or two elsewhere first.<br /><br />As for how sweet it is compared to sugar - it seems plenty sweet to me but I usually don't put a lot of sugar in my drinks.  Some suggestions to mitigate the aftertaste are:  put it in a hot drink (and drink it while it's hot), or put it in a drink with lots of other flavors to mask it, like strong chai (I could still taste it through the chai, but it's not as bad), or use half sugar and half Truvia.\",\n",

I have the original Keurig, with only one cup size, which is about 7 ounces.<br /><br />The consistency is watery.  There is no richness, no creaminess.  At the same time, the resultant brew is extremely sweet.  It doesn't really taste like white chocolate, more like fake vanilla flavoring.  The only way I can describe this is: non-fat milk, mixed with a LOT of hot water and sugar, with a touch vanilla.<br /><br />I am normally a fan of the Timothy's products, but I definitely won't buy this again.

I was concerned about people who commented that it was not a true French Roast - well it is!<br />Occasionally I drink Vienna roast which is the lightest of the dark roasts - not as dark as French.  I don't like the burnt smokey taste of Italian roast.  So it's French roast for me.<br />I knew this coffee was good just by the slight aroma without even opening the bag.  The beans are the right color for a French Roast and slightly oily, as should be.<br />I boil the water and use a filter cone to make the coffee.  This coffee is rich just like a French Roast should be.  This is the French Roast for me from now on.<br /><br />May 2012(Follow-up review.  My third bag was a lighter roast - more like a Vienna roast - but still very good quality.\",\n",

I do have a strong preference for thick and smokey French roast flavors in the morning that linger with me and I grind the whole beans like I\\'m making Expresso.

My wife - not a decaf drinker - has even switched to this.  She's a bit particular and likes the store bought, caffeinated Sumatra coffee. I was going to try the extra bold Rainforest Espresso next, based on the reviews here.  I was about to order the Rainforest product but the rich, bold coffee taste of Emeril's Jazzed Up convinced me to go with it again.  Now my wife can drink coffee in the evening and not worry about it affecting her sleep.  I'll get the Rainforest Espresso next time and add a comparison here.  The Espresso will have to be very good to get us away from this one though. I do hear that the two are comparable - we'll see.  You can use the larger setting on the machine and fill a mug without sacrificing taste.  It's just a great cup of coffee, even for decaf.

I'm sticking with Emeril's Jazzed Up decaf coffee for my k-cup selection.  While still a good cup of coffee, the Espresso lacks the smoothness I feel we get from the Jazzed up coffee.  I'm not sorry I had two boxes of the Espresso as this was a very acceptable alternative to Emeril's product, but I don't believe I'll be ordering it again.  IMHO, the Rainforest Espresso is just a small notch, or two, below the Jazzed Up coffee for the smooth and robust flavor of Emeril's Jazzed Up k cup coffee.\",\n",

       " 'I am a dark-roast coffee drinker who appreciates beans that have been roasted according to generally accepted standards (nonetheless mindful of conflicting definitions of exactly what constitutes say, French v. Italian roast, from one area to another). Apart from very well-known, and might I add expensive, whole-bean coffees sold at Amazon that I have purchased, Coffee Bean Direct Italian Roast Espresso is the first that I have purchased that is, in fact, a true Italian roast. The beans, characteristically, are almost black and are glossy with a pronounced oily surface - as they should be. I brew these beans as \"regular\" coffee as well as Espresso and find that, in either case, they present me the precise dark-roast flavor that I seek. I must admit that my palate, whose acuity is mollified by Balkan pipe tobacco, cannot adequately distinguish the subtle differences amongst different varieties of beans. As a consequence, my singular focus is on the precision of the roasting. Coffee Bean Direct Italian Roast Espresso is spot on in that regard, producing an exquisite cup of coffee - if one prefers a very dark roast. Finally, at a little over $5 per pound, I dare say one is not likely to find a superior, similar roast, at twice the cost. At $27 for a five pound bag (and free shipping), I believe few would be disappointed with this roast as is. Furthermore, one could use this roast, blending it with \"common\" coffees found on local grocers\\' shelves to add body - and flavor. Well done, Amazon!',\n",

What confused me was this is a good one. Darks usually are bitter to me. I always thought many producers put in additives for the dark flavor. Not one I find too pleasant usually. I\\'ve been avoiding dark roasts for a while and now found a good one. Good quality at a price that is hard to beat. Oils on the beans really flavor it up! Good smoother dark roast. 5 lbs of Quality.<br /><br />So two years later I\\'m still buying this coffee. I have ordered for other people because I have Prime and every time the comment is \"That is a giant bag.\" and then \"I told you it was five pounds when I ordered.\"  Five pounds in person is a lot. This really is a bargain. All have liked it. The other flavors are good too.',\n",
       " 'On their web site, Coffee Bean Direct advertises this as their darkest roast. Previously, on Amazon, I reviewed Coffee Bean Direct\\'s Italian Espresso Roast and find the Super Dark Espresso to be equally good and only slightly different. For my basic observations see the previous review; this review will serve to give the reader my observations made in a side-by-side comparison.<br /><br />I have uploaded an image of the two roasts, the Italian Espresso on the left, the Super Dark Espresso on the right. Both are, clearly, Espresso roasts as evidenced by the surface oil on the beans. Both roasts are slightly unevenly roasted, the Italian Espresso more so than the Super Dark. Not clearly shown in the image is the fact that a small percentage of the beans of the Super Dark roast are starting to break apart, a consequence of exceeding the usual roasting temperatures of the so-called \"second crack.\" So what? It indicates to me that the Super Dark roast beans have been roasted to a point beyond which further roasting would not be possible without destroying the beans (yielding a charcoal-like product). However, as noted, the added roasting has produced a more even dark roast which, in turn, has produced a coffee that is slightly more rich than the Italian Espresso roast. Here I would emphasize the word \"slightly\"; apart from a side-by-side sampling, I doubt I could distinguish one from the other on a day-to-day basis.<br /><br />In a word, both roasts are superb and nicely priced. If I recall correctly, the Super Dark roast cost $3.00 more than the Italian Espresso roast, I should think a reasonable difference if one\\'s palate is able to differentiate between the two roasts.<br /><br />In either case, I think anyone who enjoys dark roast coffees or Espresso will be happy with either of these blends.',\n",

Many people actually confuse the two which isn't difficult to do: donut house and donut shop -- both are extra bold in flavor, and both are excellent.  Since Donut Shop is my favorite, I decided to conduct a taste test between these two rivals.  Side to side they are very similar, very little acid taste, no bitterness which is what I look for in an extra bold roast.  Head to head Donut Shop edged this coffee, Donut House, out by the slightest of margin.  Donut Shop had slightly more body to it but frankly, it took me drinking a half cup of each before I could declare a winner.

       " \"Despite giving Emeril's Big Easy Bold five stars, I think it only fair to open with a couple of negative points. First, if you're looking for authentic New Orleans style coffee, you'll likely be disappointed by the lack of chicory root. Frankly, I doubt that most coffee drinkers will mourn the lost chicory. Second, this coffee is a concentrated dark roast; if you're fan of light roasts and mild coffees, this variety will probably taste ashy and too strong.<br /><br />We just started using our Keurig B40 last week, and the first few k-cups I tried were disappointingly watery. The Emeril's Big Easy Bold is one of the few blends I've found that provides a full-bodied cup of coffee without any harsh overtones and without any nasty, bitter after-taste. Made with a single varietal (Colombian-grown arabica), Emeril's Big Easy Bold brews up with a rich cocoa aroma and a thin trace of crema. The flavor includes caramel, chocolate, and fruity notes with a hint of pepperiness, but the chocolate note lingers in the finish.<br /><br />I don't add sugar or cream to my coffee, but I doubt that either addition would detract from the overall experience.

I use K-cups at work because we have no facility for rinsing/cleaning/getting water for a regular machine.<br /><br />Sumatran coffees generally have a very rich, earthy taste; some would describe it as being \"tangy\" almost. Having tried the two other main brands of Sumatran for K-cups, the Puck is by far the best. It is not as bold as something you would get from Starbucks or from roasting yourself, but it has all the flavor elements of a good Sumatran cup. It especially has that nice earthy taste. Even the aftertaste is rich.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: If you are looking for a k-cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting, this coffee is not for you. In my opinion you get a Sumatran because you love strong coffee. Watered down it loses its distinctiveness. Get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor. I make mine with 2 k-cups, at the smallest setting. By camparison, I would give a Starbucks Sumatra mandheling a 10/10 rating for boldness.

A flavored, brewed coffee has a more intense and better flavor and has a more effective caffeine jolt, but the Taster's Choice instant is good in its own right.<br />One problem with these coffee packets is that adding too much water can dillute  the taste enough to produce a bland tasting hot beverage. Were I to drink these as my morning coffee, I'd need to make at least three cups to get me going.<br /><br />Mostly I drink these as an after nap cup of coffee at home or as a pick me up cup of coffee at work.

I don't care for all the wasteful,extra packaging, and tearing open a single packet envelope while half awake in an unwelcome introduction to the day. Sometimes it's easier just to cut it open with scissors.<br /><br />2. I also am not crazy about the small serving size of individual cups. A jar of coffee would be much preferable, but for whatever reasons Nescafe has chosen to go the single serving route.<br /><br />Finally: I like Nescafe Taster's Choice Vanilla instant coffee and enjoy it as an occasional treat.

Truvia had a slight aftertaste but nowhere near as strong as this and nowhere near as lasting. I'll be switching back once I finish the SweetLeaf I already paid for.<br /><br />One thing that's worth noting: Ability to taste certain kinds of bitterness varies from person to person due to genetic factors. For example, some people find grapefruit intolerably bitter while to others it is pleasant; the former have receptors on their tongues that are sensitive to a specific chemical in the fruit, while the latter don't. It is entirely possible that the people giving this product positive reviews truly don't experience the aftertaste I'm talking about.

I used Cafix for a while, and did like it as a good substitute, but it just wasn\\'t coffee.  We\\'ve been using HealthWise for a few months now, and we really like it.  It\\'s real coffee without the acidity, and easy on the stomach.  It seems to be a bit \"drier\" than full acid coffee, but it still seems to have a lot of body, and no bitter flavor.  It\\'s also great to be able to return to the ritual of brewing a pot.  Spooning something out of a jar just isn\\'t the same.  If you have issues with coffee acidity, give this a try.  We have not been able to find it in stores, so I order it from Amazon.',\n",

That is the way that I start my morning and a friend advised me to try a low acid coffee.  After a web search and trying several low acid coffees, I selected Healthwise as my favorite.  I drink it every morning and it doesn't upset my stomach at all.\",\n",

Very full flavored coffee.<br /><br />I came across this as the word \"Crema\" caught my eye. Now I am ordering it using the subscribe and save. It is running me $17.41 for every order and that\\'s with free 2 day shipping because of the Prime Membership.<br /><br />Each brick lasts about 10 days for 2 people drinking 6 cups of coffee every morning. I use 1 tablespoon coffee for every 6 ounces of water brewed in a Target Michael Graves design automatic drip coffeemaker. The \"Flavor\" button really brings it out in this coffee. I love my coffee with half and half and it really seems to compliment it well.<br /><br />The packages are vacuumed sealed and take up very little space. It really is a 5 star coffee.',\n",
       " 'I found a brick of Lavazza Crema e Gusto at a local shop some months ago, and tried it in my stovetop espresso maker. For some reason I thought the grind was what I needed (it *does* have a picture of a stovetop machine on it!) but the grind is really very fine, more like what a professional-type machine needs.<br /><br />But this works even in my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001DJT7G\">Bialetti Brikka 4-Cup Stovetop Percolator</a> stovetop machine, and generates a beautiful crema. The Brikka really wants a slightly coarser grind, so I have to be *very* careful to put in the coffee with a light touch, and not to pack it down even a tiny bit.<br /><br />The flavor, as others have written, is very rich without being too dark-roasted, with lovely chocolatey notes. Bitterness can come if I overfill the maker so that the coffee is packed too hard, which causes boiling and burning. So care must be taken when using a stovetop maker. But it\\'s truly worth it, because it gives such delicious coffee.',\n",
       " \"I purchased this to use with my Bialetti Moka, and it is delicious!<br /><br />I like to use 2 to 3 heaping teaspoons in my 6-cup maker, and it makes enough for two (large) lattes.<br /><br />It reminds me of working in Starbucks...that smell of delicious brewing coffee and espresso!<br /><br />(Unlike Starbucks coffee, however, this coffee is smooth and doesn't taste burnt at all.)<br /><br />The packaging was a bit smaller than expected, but a little sure goes a long way!\",\n",
       " \"I drink espresso (moka) daily, and go through a 250g/8.8oz brick in about 2 weeks. In my opinion, this isn't the greatest blend from Lavazza that I've had, but it's not the worst coffee I've had either (it definitely beats the drip coffee I'd otherwise get at work). It's a 70/30 robusta/arabica blend, a dark roast with a fruity though noticeably bitter finish (but not as bad as Starbucks or Peet's coffee). The Lavazza Espresso (black tin, 100% arabica claimed) tastes better than this blend, but after having tried Illy's moka grind, the different blends from Lavazza, Kimbo, Segafredo, and also blends from the local coffee roasters, I actually think that a robusta/arabica blend works best for a moka pot; just not this one. Overall, I'd say that I got what I paid for, but I didn't get what I wanted and I was seduced by the 93 or so 4/5 star reviews for this coffee. I'd really give it a 2.5 or 3 but then again, all taste is subjective, That being said, this is a reasonable coffee (considering taste vs. price), but I'll probably switch back to my regular (and unfortunately more expensive) blend.\",\n",
       " \"Really my title sums up my opinion of this cup altogether. It does make a nice, heart large cup of dark roast coffee, and $25 for 48 cups as the preorder price was outstanding. At that price, I don't think I've ever really seen better, but at the same time the brew doesn't seem quite as bold or earthy tasting as a cup of Green Mountain Dark Magic or Emeril's Big Easy Bold. I prefer a robust large cup on almost every brew, and I've realized that even the Ice Brew K-Cups are basically the same thing; a cup of coffee with extra grounds for brewing a small amount stronger...so I brew iced coffee with my Extra Bold k-cups. I did the math on weight, and these weigh in at just under a cup of Dark Magic or Sumatran Reserve, but I'd still say my favorites (by taste,) are the brands I've listed above or Tully's Italian or French Roast, Caribou Obsidian, Starbucks Dark Sumatra, or even Barista Prima French and Italian Roasts. The only other thing I can note about these is that the construction of the pods is about perfect; I didn't find any grinds in the box leaving me to believe there were no leaking pods. Almost all the pods had a little air puffing the foil out; which I've noticed a lot of the Keurig brands have flat foils, anyways, so I'm not even sure if it matters that much, although I've had grinds brew through on some of the flat pods. The only other difference I can mention is the  material of the foil top is different than Keurig brand pods; these are slightly harder and smoother (almost like a plastic or polymer,) but it doesn't seem to effect the brew process at all, and I didn't seem to get any grinds in my cup, so all in all it just doesn't matter to me. Still better than brewing through a regular coffee pot (even from fresh ground beans,) and I don't think I'll ever get tired of my Keurig coffee maker.\",\n",
       " \"With K-Cups being so expensive, I haven't ordered much for a while.  Most prices are over .60 per cup.  That's a lot of money a month for two daily cups of coffee.  Nothing is cheap, and neither are these at about .50 per cup.  I remember the good ol' days when the K-cups were not more than about .35 each, and it wasn't that long ago.<br /><br />I have been buying K-Cups at Costco most recently, and the Tully's they carry are okay.  Newman's Own are just okay too.  Those run .475 per cup, so that's been a little better.  This Martinson coffee comes close to the same price as the ones at Costco, but the flavor is superior.  This is the first cup of coffee I have in the morning. It's got a richer flavor, fresher somehow, than the others I have tried.\",\n",
       " \"I really like a bold cup of coffee.<br /><br />Generally if I want flavored coffee I will flavor it myself as flavoreds don't come in dark roast bold, however I expect to not have to flavor it to drink it. I want my base coffee to be an experience in itself and something that I look forward too.<br /><br />Martinson Dark Roast K-cup does not give me that coffee experience. Although the coffee is smooth, I will give it that, it is bland and kinda tastes like instant.<br /><br />Honestly I didn't spend the money I did on a Keurig machine to get a cup of instant coffee. I can do that with a pot of boiling water and a cheap jar of whatever.<br /><br />While I do not expect the same experience as I get when I grind my beans fresh and brew it in my french press, I do expect a reasonably fresh ground taste.<br /><br />On a positive note the presentation of the K-cups and the box are top notch. The black/gray combination makes the coffee look like it is presented in a tuxedo. 5 stars for the marketing department on this one as the look on the shelf is bound to grab lots of attention so that people will buy it at least once.\",\n",

I was psyched to find this box of 50 for a reasonable 57 cents each or so delivered to my doorstep. I ordered on Wednesday, and the coffee showed up Saturday morning in time for brunch. Hooray to Green Mountain and Amazon. We\\'ll be ordering more soon.',\n",

       " 'My biggest gripe with the Keurig pods is that the coffee is too weak so I always try the bold varieties.  I think I met my match with this one though. Its almost too strong for me.  I take my coffee black and this one has just a hint of bitterness. I have to use the tallest coffee cup setting when I use this pod.  Dont get me wrong...its a good cup of joe but for my taste I think I like the Emerill bold pods a tad better.<br /><br />On the plus side you can often reuse this pod for a second cup as its strong enough to still make a good cup second time around.',\n",

This is the untouchable, best Keurig coffee that I have ever encountered and I am relatively sure that once or twice while drinking it I experienced the mythical Quickening.<br /><br />Buy it, don't buy it, I don't care, just get out of my way so I can keep drinking it.

It\\'s mild, it\\'s not overly bold, it\\'s nice and mellow, it\\'s not bitter in the least, it\\'s not watery, it\\'s PERFECT.  I like my coffee with milk and sugar and this one is just the BEST.

Uh-oh, wrong product? I compared the box to my old one and found the same SKU number but the roast level has been dropped from medium to very light along with the color change. My taste test revealed exactly that... a mild, relatively tasteless coffee more like their dishwater Daybreak than the old Caribou blend. Caribou (I got this second hand) claims that their flagship blend is more of a light roast than a medium roast and they made the change accordingly. Yeah, sure. Nice try but we all know that the wholesale price of coffee has skyrocketed. Sounds to me, the skeptic, that perhaps they have been forced to switch to a cheaper coffee with less gusto and more bitterness to maintain their competitive price points. How sad. I would have gladly paid more for my favorite. The new blend is far inferior. If you\\'re a regular, have someone brew both and I bet you\\'ll have no problem distinguishing the difference. Time for a new favorite with a company that doesn\\'t play sleazy tricks on its loyal customers. If and when prices return to normal, watch the return to the old orange based on \"we listen to our customers\" and more corporate-speak BS.',\n",

I simply want a smooth cup of Joe I can drink daily and feel comforted it will be consistently the same tasting and awesome. Caribou's are the perfect fit for me.

Generally, any instant can be made drinkable if you doctor it up with enough creamer and sugar. Many of the previous reviews heaped praise on this drink, so naturally I wanted to see if Mount Hagen is really that good.<br />To make this review a bit different, I decided conduct a coffee \"throwdown\" between Mount Hagen Organic Instant Freeze Dried Coffee and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W2DSO6\">Nescafe Taster\\'s Choice Instant Coffee, Regular, 0.49-Ounce Single Sticks, 7-Count Boxes (Pack of 24)</a>. I wasn\\'t expecting the Nescafe to be better than the Mount Hagen; it\\'s just that I do drink that brand and like it. For the review, I brewed a cup of each of the instants according to instructions. Here\\'s what I found:<br /><br />Aroma- Neither of these brands has a rich aroma, but the Mt. Hagen had the edge here, mainly because it\\'s a darker roast.<br /><br />Taste- Fairly close results; the Taster\\'s Choice was not bitter and had a fairly clean finish (no undesirable aftertaste). It was pretty watery when brewed according to instructions, though. Mount Hagen chalks one up in the win column for richer flavor and a fuller body.<br /><br />Convenience/Affordability- Taster\\'s Choice is more convenient but is not more affordable than Mt. Hagen (price/ounce). Nescafe scores here on convenience.<br /><br />Eco-friendliness- Mount Hagen would seem to win because it\\'s an organically-grown product (not sure if it\\'s Fair Trade, though). However, it may have a larger carbon footprint than the Nescafe, since it\\'s imported from Germany. The 2 brands tie on this category.<br /><br />In the end, I would go with the Mt. Hagen for at-home use because of it\\'s slightly richer flavor and it\\'s organically grown. I wouldn\\'t mind keeping a couple of tubes of the Taster\\'s Choice around in a drawer or the glove compartment for a caffeine-based \"emergency\", though.',\n",

Okay it's instant coffee, so keep that in mind but if you looking for a quick coffee fix, you won't be disappointed.\",\n",

       " \"Unlike Europe where instant coffee is a huge and diverse marketplace, with Nescafe, Krona, Douwe Egberts, Maxwell House and more having umpteen products available, here in the USA there is very little choice. I'm not going to get into the instant vs. real coffee debate here, and this is an instant, so don't expect a Starbucks red eye latte. For convenience and taste however, there is no comparison to Mount Hagen (which is made in Germany incidentally) - Nescafe Gourmet series probably comes in a close second, but flavor and aroma wise this is head and shoulders above Folgers and Community brands of instant coffee, or any others for that matter. More and more people are drinking less and less coffee (we're all trying to be healthy remember?) so if you don't want to have the coffee pot on the hot plate all day, and can't afford a one cup at a time Keurig, give this a try. My only complaint is it's a little pricey, but until we have some others available in the USA to compete, I'll pay it. 5 Stars.\",\n",
       " \"OK, it's a bit more pricey than Maxwell. In fact, my husband was irritated that I would spend so much on organic instant coffee when I could pick up a generic brand at the grocery store. That was until he tasted it.<br />The taste is similar to a good fresh brewed. It's smooth and totally lacks that acidic bitterness that one often associates with instant coffee.  Some buyers, like me, will be attracted to it because it is organic. However, it is the taste that sets it apart from other instant coffees.\",\n",
       " \"I won't bore you with what has already been said. This instant coffee is a pleasure to drink in comparsion with most instant or even regular drip coffees. It is smooth and creamy even if a little bland looking to the eye. Even the aftertaste is pleasant as it lingers in your mouth for quiet a while. I find that I have to use a double portion of the prescribed teaspoon of instant coffee to achieve a decent taste per cup. The price is reasonable and the taste good but let me share my reluctance.<br /><br />My only reluctance about this instant coffee is simply because I am a coffee snob. Starbucks VIA instant coffee is far better tasting instant with its only drawback being about $1 per cup. With a double portion of Mount Hagen instant coffee the price is about $0.25 a cup ($46 Amazon cost / 6 packs / 30 double servings per pack = ~$0.25) Furthermore, I wouldn't trade in my regular drip, french press, or chemex coffees for this instant as they are incomparable and an unfair comparsion.<br /><br />Now why would I dare to compare this instant to other ground coffees? Simply because other reviewers have posted saying Mount Hagen is as good as regular. Unless you're drinking Folgers, Maxwell House, or some other coffee made with ground tires and run through an old shoe, no, this instant is not as good. I would reach for a good coffee of drip coffee over this coffee any day of the week.<br /><br />But for what this instant is and the price, it is excellent. If you keep in mind that sometimes you only need one cup of coffee at night or on the go, you simply cannot lose with Mount Hagen's instant coffee. Again, it has an fantastic taste (for an instant) and won't break the bank. But don't expect this instant to knock your socks off either.\",\n",

The leading energy drinks are selling for $2-$4 at convenience stores, so purchasing just one a day sets you back $60 per month or $720 per year.<br /><br />Stok can save you a lot of money. How much? Well, the company recommends that you use no more than two containers (80mg of total caffeine) each day. Two containers cost about $0.15 total, which means you can drink Stok for 3-4 weeks for the same price as a single can of an energy drink.<br /><br />My recommendation is that you pour the shot into your cup first and follow it up with the coffee, either hot or iced. I don\\'t recommend drinking Stok by itself but some of my co-workers tried it, but never twice.<br /><br />I notice the biggest difference in the afternoon.

After plenty of research, I settled on the Office Pro.<br /><br />The major complaint I read about this model was that it wasn't exactly quiet.  Those reviews are correct, to an extent.  I don't think it's so loud as to be any more distracting than any other noise in the home.  It's certainly a lot quieter than my vacuum and my washer.  I can't hear it in the next room, and neighbors haven't complained about the noise in the surrounding apartments.<br /><br />I have read review after review of the home brewers with the quiet technology, and I noticed that the one common complaint with those was that the pump failed after a couple months.  I'd rather deal with a bit of noise than with a dead coffee maker.<br /><br />We are avid coffee drinkers, and we always use travel mugs in the morning.  There isn't a setting for a 16 ounce cup, but we get around that by brewing two 6 ounce cups with a singular k-cup.  It give us the perfect amount and intensity of coffee, and leaves enough room for cream and sugar.<br /><br />I love that everyone can have exactly whatever kind or flavor of coffee that they want.  No more having to drink chocolate peppermint coffee in the morning because I wasn't the first one up and I don't want to waste a whole pot.  I also love that it's always a fresh cup of coffee.  No more burnt, old coffee.  Just a nice fresh cup.<br /><br />I find that there is a nice variety of K-cups as well, and if you shop around you can usually get them at a great price.  My local Bed, Bath and Beyond carries them and you can use a 20% off coupon on them.  Impact Office Pro also carries them online, for even cheaper than Keurig's site with their coffee club discount.<br /><br />Speaking of prices, I got my Office Pro for a lot cheaper.  Staples has them for $129.99 and you can use a coupon.  My account rep at Impact Office Pro went a little lower than the Staples price, and then even took my $25 Staples coupon, bringing the price down even more.  So shop around and see where you can get the best deal!<br /><br />A word of warning, the my k cup reusable filter offered by Keurig does not work with this model.  However, the solofill refillable k-cup does work so if you want to use your own coffee, buy the solofill k cup.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this brewer.

I don\\'t expect things to last forever but most of the people that I have given the Keurig to only get about two years of use out of them before their pumps fail.  I replaced my B70 with a Breville and it just recently passed away.<br /><br />Before I let myself calculate just how much money that I have spent on an \"easy\" way to make a cup of coffee I purchased this unit.  Overall I am very pleased with it.  It doesn\\'t have all of the bells and whistles of my other K-cup coffee makers, but it\\'s got enough of the features that I need (however, I do miss the clock.). One thing that is really nice is that it has a drain feature, something missing from my other Keurigs.  This allows one to drain the unit of the water that is deep inside the machine, preparing it for transport or storage.<br /><br />The one real feature that caused me to buy this model over the others will take a while to prove itself, and that is DURABILITY.

(Could be the coffee -- I use Gloria Jean\\'s Hazelnut bought here on Amazon.)  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZKI\">Gloria Jean\\'s Coffees,Hazelnut K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>  I also got the Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha which was way too sweet for my taste, but my son loves it. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EE0TYK\">Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha, 12-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 3)</a>  I also got the Keurig Carousel which I\\'m really happy with. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PVYW48\">Keurig 5071 K-Cup Carousel Tower</a>  I saw the carousel today at Target, where it cost $1 more (plus tax).<br /><br />The best part is, I found this on a site called eCrater (seller coffeehots) for $87.99 -- no tax, free shipping.  I ordered it last Tuesday, and had it on Friday.  I was wary of ordering from them (found them Googling, looking for coupons), but they had a lot of recent positive reviews so I took a chance, and was very pleasantly surprised.  The model I got was the current B145 model, complete with an 18-pack sampler of K-cups.  Set-up was a breeze -- there was a quick set-up guide that walks you through what to do; I was drinking my first cup of coffee within 5-10 minutes of taking the maker out of the box.  : )<br /><br />When you register your machine with Keurig, they send you a code so if you buy 2 boxes of K-cups, you get 2 free.  I ended up with 4 boxes, plus 3 samplers for $39.05 (free shipping, because my original order was over $45).  The Keurig website is a great place to go to see ALL the K-cups offered -- over 200 of them.  Plus they sell samplers that contain 5 K-cups for around $3 -- a great way to be able to test obscure flavors (like Southern Pecan) without buying a whole box.  There are a lot of customer reviews there too, just like Amazon, which was really helpful.  (That\\'s where I got the idea of running a K-cup through twice.)  The prices are comparable with Amazon\\'s but with the free Prime shipping, I think Amazon wins out.  Still, it\\'s a good place to get flavors that Amazon doesn\\'t offer.<br /><br />All in all, I\\'m very happy with my purchase.  Now I can have a fresh cup of coffee whenever I want, and I don\\'t end up having to throw out the occasional half-a-pot.  And it\\'s so convenient compared to making a pot of coffee -- no filters to worry about, no loose coffee grinds, no washing the pot, the different flavors, etc.  I love my new toy!  : )',\n",
       " 'After weeks of \"studying\" the Keurig coffeemaker choices and being spooked by the mixed reviews, I happened upon the commercial model, the OfficePro.  Like the other reviewer, I found it at Staples for much less than listed here and less than the price of the other home models.  Out of the box it didn\\'t seem to work. There was a terrible deafening vibration and noise, and no water would transfer to the heating chamber for the priming process (the first and only step before being able to make coffee).  I put it aside, annoyed, but decided to give it one more try before I packed it back up and returned it to Staples. For some reason it decided to work and it\\'s been working flawlessly since.<br /><br />My particular OfficePro came with a coffee sampler which was nice because once you have it out of the box, it\\'s great to be able to make a cup of test coffee.  The first cup of coffee I made smelled just like wonderful restaurant coffee and nothing like the stale bitter coffee I was making every day (and pouring out half of) in my gross coffee pot.  Since then I\\'ve been trying all sorts of coffee and experimenting with sizes and even using the K cups more than once.  If you brew a small cup, you can run one more small size cup through the K cup (a bold variety) without it being too watered down - yay, a money saver.  The husband and I like lots of cream so the smaller size yield suits us just fine. The 8 oz size is plenty for our mugs. I saw some complaints where the water chamber is too small and has to be refilled all the time, but as we\\'re not using this in an office setting, it\\'s been absolutely no problem for us.  Filling the water chamber is fast and easy. Initially I used tap water in the machine but have switched to bottled to ensure that it continues to work well.  Aesthetically it looks really nice and tidy tucked back into a corner on our kitchen counter and the bonus is that I can refill the water and open and close the coffee pod without having to pull it out from under the overhead cabinets; there\\'s plenty of clearance.  It makes some vibration and noise when the water heats up but the noise is very temporary, maybe about 5 seconds.<br /><br />So far we\\'ve had this about a week and it\\'s fantastic with great tasting coffee and tea.',\n",
       " \"UPDATE: Old morning routine - stumble around in the kitchen, tripping over the dogs' beds while I rinsed the coffee pot, dug out a filter and filled the basket with coffee, poured water into the coffee maker, and waited 10 minutes for the pot to brew.  NEW MORNING ROUTINE: Stumble into the kitchen (some things never change), drop a k-cup into the machine, put my coffee cup under the dispenser, and Nirvana pours from this lovely machine in under 30 seconds from heat up to fresh cup of coffee! And if I want a second cup? Pop in another k-cup and the magic happens all over again. This makes me ridiculously happy, and now I know why so many people love their Keurigs!<br />***<br />I bought my Keurig Officepro B145 from a vendor on ecrater for under $90. Was able to use paypal so I didn't have to give them a credit card. Came brand new in the box, with a variety box of k-cup coffees. I also registered it on the Keurig website, which entitled me to two FREE large boxes of coffees with the purchase of two large boxes.  This coffee maker is a dream come true! Set up was very simple. It did make a loud rumbling noise when I primed it by brewing a cup of water the first time. But by the time we popped in the first k-cup and hit brew, it was working fine.<br />Heats the water very quickly - from the time I turn on the power until it's ready to brew a cup is under five minutes. If I leave the power on, it takes maybe 20-30 seconds to brew a 10-oz. cup of coffee.<br /><br />This machine does not use the k-cup adapters - you need to get the solofill brand of adapters if you want to use your own coffee. If you worry about the impact of all that plastic on the environment, do like us. I rip the foil top off the used k-cups and dump the coffee into my compost pile. The plastic and foil go into the recycling.<br /><br />I just LOVE being able to simply pop a k-cup into the lid, hit brew, and 30 seconds later I have a cup of the most delicious and HOT coffee. No pot or filters to clean. Simple and simply delicious.\",\n",
       " \"Just bought a few of these along with the paper filters. I've been refilling and reusing the regular k-cups and although cost effective and environmentally responsible, a big mess.  The biggest issue I had with refilling was that it was a pain and it was a bit messy.  I could also only get a few good uses before the filter deteriorated.<br /><br />Now here comes these new EZ-Cups!  These are simple to use.  Throw in a filter, add your favorite roast, snap on the lid and brew. There is a spring and a tamper built into the EZ-Cup so that when you snap on the lid the coffee gets tamped/compressed a bit so that the hot water flows through uniformly. The best part is that the cleanup up is a breeze!  Open the lid to the EZ-Cup and toss the filter and used grounds.  Ready for the next cup! No mess and I think very convenient. Brew quality is excellent as you can choose your own favorites and control how much coffee to use. These just work!<br /><br />Great idea!\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve been wanting to stop using sweetener in my coffee, but haven\\'t been able to make the plunge back to sugar.

I actually like both of them!  I can\\'t decide which is better.  My husband uses half sugar and half coffee - so I was hoping this would be good for him since the Agave nectar makes his coffee taste like honey with the amount he feels he has to use...this container is pretty small to keep up with his coffee habit!  It would be great if we could purchase this in larger quantities! I will purchase again.',\n",
       " \"I guess I'm a bit of a coffee snob. I always groan when friends suggest we go to Dunkin' Donuts for joe. Even their dark roast is nearly flavorless. So when I saw some of the glowing reviews for the Community coffees I was of course skeptical. I am currently spending about $10/lb. for AMAZING coffee from a local roaster. I have to buy 12 pounds at a time to get that price! So I've been looking for ways to cut my coffee budget without settling for flavorless coffee. When I saw Amazon's 30% off promo I took a chance. And boy am I glad I did!<br /><br />This is a very full-flavored coffee. I wouldn't say it had a complexity of flavors like my favorite African origin blends I get from my local roaster, but it is flavorful and satisfying. I just purchased 10 pounds of the Community Coffee Dark Roast, so I can't wait to try it next!<br /><br />One tip for longer term coffee storage: I double bag my coffee in freezer quality Hefty OneZip bags. I use the jumbo size 2-1/2 gal bags and arrange the coffee bags inside the OneZip bags so they fill up the space as much as possible. Then I put a second OneZip bag over the first but I flip the outer bag so the closure is on the OPPOSITE end from the closure of the inner bag. All these steps keep as much freezer air out of the coffee as possible. I have been keeping my coffee like that for up to 3 months and I have found no difference in taste from the first bag to the last. You can always use 1 gal freezer bags too if you store less coffee. Just make sure you use the same double bag setup.<br /><br />I take one pound out of the freezer at a time for making coffee, and store it in the refrigerator in a freezer bag between uses. Another little trick I have found is to cut an inch off the top of the bag with scissors as you use the coffee up. Then I fold it neatly and tightly down to the remaining coffee in the bag and clip it with a medium sized binder clip. I find I spill less coffee this way because my coffee scoop is short and doesn't reach down into the bag very well as it get's lower and lower.<br /><br />I know...I'm a total coffee-geek!\",\n",
       " 'After FINALLY purchasing <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA\">the best coffee maker</a> I\\'ve ever had in 40 years of drinking coffee, the hunt was on to find the best tasting coffee to go with it. When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it\\'s really a \"to each his or her own\" thing. But I\\'ve tried \\'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril\\'s Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril\\'s Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they\\'re bold. I\\'ve tried the \"Midnight Magic\" brand; I\\'ve tried the \"Jet Fuel\" brand; I\\'ve tried the \"Donut Shop\" brand; I\\'ve tried all of the \"Extra Bolds\"; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril\\'s Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What\\'s really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril\\'s Big Easy Bold, you won\\'t lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril\\'s.<br /><br />There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that\\'s full of flavor and packs a punch, you\\'ve found the right page here at Amazon. Wake up people, and add this to your cart. Bam!',\n",
       " 'I ran across this coffee when looking for a dark and \\'bold\\' coffee.  I\\'ve always called that \"a good strong cup of coffee\".<br />This coffee meets my criteria for that.  It is not bitter and doesn\\'t leave a bad coffee taste in your mouth.<br /><br />I\\'m a tightwad so the $.55/Kcup appealed to me also.  Sometimes I add a teaspoon of my favorite instant and rotate the Kcup 180 deg. and run it through again.  This gives me a second good cup of coffee at reduced prices.:)<br /><br />I will buy more of the Big Easy Bold.',\n",
       " \"This product that comes in the Amazon packaging is defective. It appears in an attempt to save cost, too little foil material is used to seal the top of the K-cup.  As a result, when the K-cup is punctured by the Keurig coffee maker, the foil lid separates from the side of the k-cup, resulting in an explosion of coffee grounds in the coffee maker.  Only 1 of 3 k-cups did not do this.  It is specifically this brand/packaging, since I was making other varieties of k-cup coffee in the same coffee maker in the same time and none of those broke the seal and left grounds all in the coffee maker.<br />Looking at the seal on this product, compared to other K-cups varieties, this seal is MUCH tighter, and since there is a larger amount of coffee grounds in this k-cup, there's a lot more to make a mess!<br />Loved the taste of the coffee, but can't waste so much time cleaning up the coffee pot!  Don't buy in the Amazon hassle-free packaging, you'll be sorry!\",\n",
       " \"I am sure that this coffee tastes good, but I am not sure I will ever get to find out. Each cup I insert into my Keurig busts open when it is brewing.  I don't think the seal can withstand the heat, and so it opens up and oozes grounds into my coffee! YUCK!!\",\n",

But I find the Tully's House Blend to have a great mix of being rich and flavorful, but still very drinkable anytime.  It may be my favorite k-cup right now, and I will definitely keep a stock of it around our house.\",\n",

That means this bag contains about 00.30 ounces of Kopi Luwak as it\\'s a 200 gram bag.  My point?  Drinking a cup of this is not drinking a cup of Kopi Luwak, but just a very expensive cup of normal coffee, period.  Amazon should be ashamed to be selling this.

This coffee only has 2% Kopi-Luwak, purely for marketing purposes so they can charge you outrageous price for average coffee.

In my opinion, one of the worst cups of coffee I ever tasted.<br /><br />I do highly recommend buying 100% kopi-luwak as it is the smoothest, most organic cup of coffee I've ever tasted.  Not better than Jamaican Blue Mountain, but definitely as good.  Like JBM, Kopi-Luwak has it's own very unique and ultra smooth characteristics. Fantastic but at $70 a pound, it's definitely a weekend coffee.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this coffe.\",\n",
       " \"I have tasted the kopi luwak coffee. Yes, it is processed through an animal's intestinal tract, but pleasantly, I can assert all fecatorial concerns are diminished once the beans are presented to the company by the blessed animal.<br /><br />I have had this in espresso, cappuccino and regular brew form. It tastes like a very decent cup of coffee, but nothing so remarkable that it requires its excessive cost.<br /><br />It is expensive at any price above the market value of a standard Sumatran bean, as the value is not in the taste (ordinary), but its exoticness.<br /><br />Civets eat the coffee berries and then pass the beans. In doing so, various chemicals are extracted that normally are part of coffee we are familiar with. Is it is enough to lift the quality to one worth the investment? No.<br /><br />If the idea is intriguing, and you want to say you have tasted all life offers, consider the kopi luwak bean. You will have a very good cup of coffee and a great laugh.

Caribou (I got this second hand) claims that their flagship blend is more of a light roast than a medium roast and they made the change accordingly. Yeah, sure. Nice try but we all know that the wholesale price of coffee has skyrocketed.

Life span of a water heater is 5-8 years.)<br /><br />I tend to like full-bodied/full-flavored coffee (that doesn\\'t always mean \"strong\"). Therefore, I tend to like the dark roasts better, which is why I find Donut Shop just a bit lacking (but I like it enough that I still drink it).<br /><br />After trying the variety pack (and having since bought this item by itself as verified above), I can honestly say that by far my new favorite K-Cup is Jet Fuel (and I\\'ve tried at least 15-20 different varieties, not including flavored or decaf coffee). It has full flavor that is really good, but has no \"strong\" characteristics IMO (i.e. bitter, burnt, dense, etc.). When I took the first sip of Jet Fuel, I immediately thought, \"Wow, this is good coffee!\"<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like a full-bodied coffee that doesn\\'t have any bitterness or burnt characteristics, and is not too dense.',\n",

I called to talk to \"the coffee people\", 2x - never got a human, left my phone number both times, and have never gotten a call back in since the orginal call 10 days ago.

So I got the Coffee People\\'s Extra Bold sampler pack which included, Black Tiger, Wake Up Call, Organic, and Jet Fuel.

Its only downside in taste is a very slight acidic aftertaste.<br /><br />I use this coffee at work and at home. Instead of going to Starbucks everyday, I now spend approximately 25-50 cents (depending on how much coffee I drink) a day on a similar caliber instant coffee. I think Bustelo should introduce a smaller packet size so the coffee will be more portable for travels.<br /><br />I have also tried Starbucks VIA. Although VIA is also a nice instant coffee, it costs almost $2 (2 packets) per a large cup. At that price, it is actually cheaper to go to Starbucks and buy its fresh brew.<br /><br />If you are looking for the best instant coffee that comes close to a quality of a high quality brewed coffee at an affordable price, then look no further.

My taste test revealed exactly that... a mild, relatively tasteless coffee more like their dishwater Daybreak than the old Caribou blend.  Caribou (I got this second hand) claims that their flagship blend is more of a light roast than a medium roast and they made the change accordingly. Yeah, sure. Nice try but we all know that the wholesale price of coffee has skyrocketed.  Sounds to me, the skeptic, that perhaps they have been forced to switch to a cheaper coffee with less gusto and more bitterness to maintain their competitive price points.  How sad.

       " 'This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can\\'t find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you\\'re curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it\\'s compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I\\'d like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they\\'re reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it\\'s very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it\\'s capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn\\'t be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own \"stand\" in order to fill it properly.',\n",
       " 'Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don\\'t love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the \"old fashion way\" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don\\'t feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won\\'t be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I.

       " 'When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn\\'t much better. Third time\\'s a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you\\'ll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16\" thick, 5/32\" inside diameter, and 3/8\" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493.',\n",
       " \"At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.  Good coarse grind, check.  No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.  I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail!<br />We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean.  We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.<br />Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug.\",\n",
       " \"Just got the Ekobrew today and tried it out. I have been a Solofill fan since they came out but the Ekobrew design seems to beat the Solofill. First off, the flat bottom makes it easy to fill. I usually run two cycles for a larger cup of coffee. With the Ekobrew the lid stays shut and doesn't leak water at the top. I was surprised how easily the grounds came out and just a quick rinse and it was ready to go again. Seems to be the best choice around for avoiding the high cost of K cups.\",\n",
       " \"WOW - we got our keurig as a gift and with the gift was a big box of the k-cups with all the eh, average tasting coffees...but once those ran out we would never be the people to spend that much money on coffee every month. so we have been using the solofil for about 8 months. we hated it and because of it, hated the keurig. the coffee we buy (the strongest roast from starbucks) was always watery and the solofil would leak all the time and it was such a pain to clean. but we put up with it. ENTER the ekobrew! omg this thing is amazing. i don't know what makes it so much different and i don't care -i just care that we get an amazing cup of coffee from our machine now!  SUCH  a difference. we used to use the solofil twice for one cup of coffee - we would make two of the smallest cups to make it as strong as possible. not anymore!! highly recommend! buying 2 more!\",\n",
       " \"My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys.\",\n",
       " \"With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time.  Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!\",\n",
       " 'As a huge fan of Keurig brewing, I was delighted to discover Solofill cups!  I have been using mine for a couple months and love the versatility and the ease of using this Kcup replacement.  Unlike the \"My Kcup\" holder that you can use with most Keurig machines, this little gem pops right in without having to remove the pod holder from the brewer.<br /><br />The Solofill takes about 2 tablespoons of coffee and that\\'s the main appeal of this.  You can use your own ground coffee instead of always having to buy the pricey pre-filled Kcups.  It makes a great cup of coffee and allows users to buy any kind of coffee they please.  Some users have complained about cleaning the Solofill.  I find it easy.  Just tap the cooled coffee grounds on the edge of your trash receptacle and most will fall out.  Then rinse it out and it\\'s ready to go again.  I keep two handy so I can be using one and cleaning the other.  I see this little invention as a great way to save money and have options as to the kinds and types of coffee you want to use.',\n",
       " \"I was a little worried about this one because of a bad (weak coffee) experience w/ the My K-Cup, but this product worked remarkably well!  I didn't think it was difficult to clean using the spray nozzle on the faucet.  Also, be careful not to use super fine grounds (as suggested on the package).  They will plug up the mesh and result in a half brew of coffee so strong it can not be consumed!  Kirkland 100% Columbian-fine ground works well, however.\",\n",
       " \"I love my keurig coffee maker, don't get me wrong, but I don't love adding all those little plastic cups to the land fill. The Solofill allows me to end the conflict between convenience and my concern for the environment.  I can use any coffee I like, or as I frequently do, I can use a pod.  One of the things about the Keurig I love is the ability to choose daily between varieties of coffee.  Buying a pound of one kind of coffee is boring to me. So I buy locally 1/4 bags and store them in a vented airproof (airscape) container. And I buy pods (frequently on sale so the price is the same as ground beans per cup) and dump the grounds into the Solofill. I use 10 gram pods, more is too much, less is not enough. With pods, the coffee remains fresh because it's nitrogen packed. I don't have to drink all the same kind at once to use it up =)  So i balance between my locally purchased fresh ground and the pods. The Solofill brews a much better cup than the K cups provide. Much richer mouth feel, and slightly stronger than an extra bold k cup.<br />I drink mostly dark roasts (k cups: dark magic, double black diamond) and I'm very satisfied with the cups from a Solofill with 10 grams ground coffee, either from a pod or fresh.  The device self-tamps when you close it so the water flows evenly throughout the grounds. No dry spots. I pop the Keurig open after I brew and come back to dump the grounds after I drink; that gives the solofill time to cool off.  The only caveat is to make sure you flick off any grounds on the rim before you close the solofill so it makes a solid seal. I bought two so I can always have one ready to go......\",\n",
       " \"I have the Keurig My K-Cup and found it to be annoying to have to pull out the insert to use it after I use an actual k-cup.  This eliminates that and I've found it to make a better cup of coffee as well.  It's a nice one piece design so no messing with the 3 pieces like the My K-cup.  Works great.\",\n",
       " \"Great Coffee taste with all the flavors of fresh ground coffee and a French Press with out the mess.  Solofill Cup is almost idiot proof.  If you can read and follow directions you will have no problem with this.  My K Cup works fine, but the Solofill Cup works better.  Easier to use, better flow, more of the flavors of fresh ground coffee come through.  If you use the right grind, only fill to the fill line, make sure the gasket is clean and snap the lid shut it will work right every time.  Added bonus, when I am in a hurry and snap a factory K Cup in, I don't have to change the filter holder.  Best $15.00 spent in awhile.  Get to use local custom blend fresh whole bean coffee that tastes as good as French Press.  My K Cup coffee always lacked some of the flavor, Solofill Cup does not.\",\n",

I am a coffee addict and could drink it all day if it didn't keep me up all night. I have tried every other do it yourself k cup product out there and they all stink! This product actually works. It brews a decent cup of coffee,  not watered down and not a single ground of coffee in the cup. This product is worth the money! Thinking about buying a second!\",\n",

Since K-cups are nitrogen-packed, the coffee doesn\\'t go stale, so the last cup is as good as the first. If there are a couple of dark-roast lovers in your family, a box of 50 will be slurped down in no time.

It probably cost them a fraction of a fraction of a cent to make it a little more attractive, and I appreciate that!<br /><br />When you first got your Keurig brewer, you drank through the sampler coffees... and if you asked yourself, \"Is that as dark as it gets??\" then I think you\\'ll go for Jet Fuel or one of the other Coffee People EBs.<br /><br />P.S.

I don\\'t make smaller cups to make it stronger, nor do I run extra water to make it weaker. I judge each k-cup in 9.25oz. It should also be noted that I use spring water exclusively in my machine; done for both taste and machine longevity. (The tap water where I live is brutal. Life span of a water heater is 5-8 years.)<br /><br />I tend to like full-bodied/full-flavored coffee (that doesn\\'t always mean \"strong\"). Therefore, I tend to like the dark roasts better, which is why I find Donut Shop just a bit lacking (but I like it enough that I still drink it).<br /><br />After trying the variety pack (and having since bought this item by itself as verified above), I can honestly say that by far my new favorite K-Cup is Jet Fuel (and I\\'ve tried at least 15-20 different varieties, not including flavored or decaf coffee). It has full flavor that is really good, but has no \"strong\" characteristics IMO (i.e. bitter, burnt, dense, etc.).

Our family results are mixed.  My wife likes this coffee and drinks it a few times each day.  My experience was that the coffee flavor is still good but the hot water passes through the coffee and filter paper too quickly which produces a watered-down coffee flavor.  I wish the San Francisco Bay Coffee company would get the necessary licenses to put their coffee into actual K-Cup pods.  If the price was competitive, my wife and I would be steady customers.

This product is their source. I often order coffee from Hawaii or Costa Rica and tend to buy the best brands locally, because I truly enjoy a good cup of coffee. This particular coffee has a flavor that reminds of a french or dark roast, but it lies a bit more softly and pleasingly on the palate. Like a fine wine or light dessert. There is a mellow boldness about it that satisfies with a smile and invites another sip, another savoring moment, another cup.

       " 'I\\'m a certified chocoholic with a weight problem. I had heard that cacao nibs had all the health benefits of dark chocolate (way more, actually) without the sugar and junk food aspects. They are loaded with antioxidants and have those powerful endorphin releasing stimulants. They are also quite high in fiber (but also in saturated fats).<br /><br />I got my big pile of Navitas Naturals nibs and dug right in. Well - these are a bit of an acquired taste; but once acquired, they really satisfy. Cacao nibs are broken pieces of raw whole cacao beans that have been fermented and dried (and that\\'s it). They are brown, with a dark cocoa smell, and a seductive texture that\\'s partly like a coffee bean (crunchy and hard), and partly like a piece of chocolate (buttery with a crisp and then melting fat). The flavor initially gives you a cocoa hit and then a winey fermented flavor that is hard to describe. The aftertaste is bitter like baking chocolate. Like a coffee bean, there\\'s some fibrous grit with the aftertaste after the creamy fats have dissolved on your tongue. My first impressions was \"phew - that\\'s disgusting\". The winey flavor was off-putting and the bitterness in the aftertaste was hard to take. That didn\\'t prevent me from immediately having more, however - as the crisp rich creamy quality made me want more. After a few pinches (maybe 3/4s of a tablespoon) I was flying! I mean, these things are POTENT. They really are loaded with all those endorphin releasing stimulants - and man they wake you up and then make you feel loved. Over the next few days I kept a big baggie of these in my pack and ate them whenever I wanted a cup of coffee. The stimulant effect is totally as strong as coffee - and more. To go with the speed, there\\'s a feeling of well being and intellectual stimulation that\\'s seductive in the extreme. I began to almost enjoy the odd powerful flavor. My only concerns at this point are whether these are addictive! About 1/2 way through my bag I have yet to hit a stem or a stone or an inedible piece (unlike what I\\'ve heard with some other brands). The flavor and texture is pretty consistent as I work my way through too - pretty good for a totally raw organic product.<br /><br />I found that I could grind them up into powder in the blender and use the powder to \"cocoa\" up various foods (especially ones bearing some sweetness). For example, after my workout I\\'d put a tablespoon of nibs and a tablespoon of chia seeds in the blender and grind nice and fine and then toss in a fist full of frozen blueberries, a glug of Walden Farms zero calorie chocolate sauce, 8 oz water and two scoops of whey protein powder (chocolate flavor, of course) and then blend. It all whips up into a rich chocolatey blueberry shake that packs the nutritional wallop of a steak dinner with omega 3 oils, TONS of antioxidants, and a wicked emotional and blood sugar pick-me-up. You can buy the powder pre-ground, but I imagine the goodies keep better in this coarsely cracked version.<br /><br />All in all - I think of cacao nibs as much as a drug like coffee as I do a food. People who eat ultra-dark chocolate for the health aspects should absolutely check nibs out because my body tells me they have WAY MORE of the chemical goodies of chocolate with far less sugar and fat. They also are brimming with a rich raw cocoa flavor that\\'s weird and wonderful and hard to describe. If you are bent in this way - this stuff is wonderful.',\n",
       " \"I have enjoyed the intense flavor, versatility, and healthful benefits of cocoa nibs for many years.  These nibs from Navitas are of consistently high quality and I recommend them to anyone who is looking for nibs. Nibs may be used to make chocolate.  I use them for a wide range of culinary purposes including: crunchy addition to yogurt, berries, desserts, ground with coffee beans for coffee.  I sometimes incorporate them into sauces if I'm not feeling lazy.  I like to cook but I tend to stick to simple things without sauces.  Unless you grind these things, only eat them if you are certain of the strength of your teeth as they are hard.  The flavor and aroma are mindful of chocolate, but unlike chocolate there is no sugar and they have a bitter finish.  I like it but your experience may vary.\",\n",

Originally I was in a gourmet store and this is where I found this coffee. Then after trying to locate this brand at a place with a better price tag I found it at World Market, but then they stopped carrying it, however, perhaps they have it back on their shelves again, I do not know. Soon later I began buying it from Sunset Foods in Highland Park, IL.  They, like World Market, had it in stock only now and then so I began to order it special from them.

I like the CONVENIENCE of getting a GREAT cup of SMOOTH coffee just heating water in my microwave and then adding the Ferrara Instant powder.  If the water is hot enough the drink will have a lovely thick crema on top.  Note: This coffee does not taste like actual coffee, but it doesn't taste anything like any other instant coffee on the shelves either, not like any other instant espresso from any company, and certainly nothing like those grocery store brand instant coffees which I find gross..., however, I admit find grocery store brand ground coffee like Folgers and Maxwell House, etc. to taste like garbage in my opinion!  For daily drip (real) coffee at my house we use Lavazza or the online subscription Gevalia brand.  So why do I also use an instant coffee like Ferrara?  Well, as I said, I love the SMOOTH taste, it gives a comforting hot drink that has a lovely flavor, and with hot enough water you will get a thick crema on top once you drop the powder into the hot water.  It is fast, and quite wonderful.  And may I add one more thing?  It takes away hunger for a couple of hours!  I just love it!!\",\n",
       " 'This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can\\'t find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you\\'re curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it\\'s compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I\\'d like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they\\'re reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it\\'s very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it\\'s capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn\\'t be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own \"stand\" in order to fill it properly.',\n",

I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the \"old fashion way\" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had!

If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don\\'t feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won\\'t be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse.

       " 'When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn\\'t much better. Third time\\'s a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you\\'ll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16\" thick, 5/32\" inside diameter, and 3/8\" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493.',\n",
       " \"At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.  Good coarse grind, check.  No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.  I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail!<br />We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean.  We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.<br />Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug.\",\n",
       " \"Just got the Ekobrew today and tried it out. I have been a Solofill fan since they came out but the Ekobrew design seems to beat the Solofill. First off, the flat bottom makes it easy to fill. I usually run two cycles for a larger cup of coffee. With the Ekobrew the lid stays shut and doesn't leak water at the top. I was surprised how easily the grounds came out and just a quick rinse and it was ready to go again. Seems to be the best choice around for avoiding the high cost of K cups.\",\n",
       " \"WOW - we got our keurig as a gift and with the gift was a big box of the k-cups with all the eh, average tasting coffees...but once those ran out we would never be the people to spend that much money on coffee every month. so we have been using the solofil for about 8 months. we hated it and because of it, hated the keurig. the coffee we buy (the strongest roast from starbucks) was always watery and the solofil would leak all the time and it was such a pain to clean. but we put up with it. ENTER the ekobrew! omg this thing is amazing. i don't know what makes it so much different and i don't care -i just care that we get an amazing cup of coffee from our machine now!  SUCH  a difference. we used to use the solofil twice for one cup of coffee - we would make two of the smallest cups to make it as strong as possible. not anymore!! highly recommend! buying 2 more!\",\n",
       " \"My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys.\",\n",
       " \"With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time.  Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!\",\n",

Perhaps it\\'s a coincidence but the last couple of coffee orders that I have placed have been most satisfying. I go to Amazon to leave feedback and I find that the coffee is suddenly unavailable? Bizarre. Here\\'s another one. I just got the coffee that I ordered. It\\'s a lovely, dark organic. I have been quite delighted with every type of coffee that I have puchased from this roaster. They are putting out some high quality beans. I\\'m quite particular about French roast. It\\'s my favorite roast and it has to be done just right. This variety was exquisitely roasted. The resulting brew was earthy, fragrant, and not too heavy on the palate. Sadly, as I write this review I see that this coffee is \"currently unavailable.\" I just ordered it! Am I some kind of a jinx? Keep checking back. It\\'s worth it!',\n",
       " 'Our office recently (and possibly misguidedly) voted a Starbucks machine off the island and replaced it with a couple of Bunn airpot makers. They\\'re great for commercial coffee but that is also the problem: it tastes like mediocre diner coffee even when good beans are used. So I\\'ve taken matters into my own hands and picked up an Espressione Cafe Novecento espresso maker and have put it in the kitchen \"on loan\" to the company.<br /><br />My first few attempts at pulling a decent shot with fresh ground coffee convinced me that I simply don\\'t have the patience to learn the proper technique so, as the machine came with a pod portafilter, I decided to give that a shot (so to speak). Illy had the highest number of positive recomendations so I settled on them for my initial foray.<br /><br />Simply put, I am impressed. The flavor is excellent, the output takes in the ballpark of 20-30 seconds a shot and has very good crema on about three out of every four shots. It can be tricky to properly seat the pod in the portafilter but moistening the pod first does help and that\\'s a more a reflection on the filter design than the pod\\'s.<br /><br />The primary reason I can\\'t give five stars (although I\\'d do four and a half if I could) is that even the Amazon price works out to almost a dollar a shot so my double Americano in the morning is only slightly less than I\\'d pay my favorite barista. And she has a really cute smile.<br /><br />All in all, though, a very positive experience and I recommend the Illy pods.',\n",
       " 'Many vocal critics of illy coffee have never actually tasted it. As Dr. House says, everybody lies and illy is apparently a very popular thing to lie about. I\\'ve caught several vocal critics lying about illy (by serving it to them, getting the typical \"This is fabulous!\" reaction, then telling them what they\\'re drinking. You know, the Folger\\'s Coffee Crystals technique).<br /><br />Why is this?<br /><br />Well, on the surface illy does appear to be frivolous and therefore an easy target.<br /><br />- It\\'s very expensive, especially for coffee that comes in a can<br />- It\\'s got a very fussy, very European marketing envelope around it<br />- It tends to be sold in fussy, trendy stores<br />- Because it\\'s roasted and packaged in Italy, it is always several months old when you buy it<br />- Did I mention that it\\'s very expensive?<br /><br />As a result, it\\'s easy to dismiss illy as an elitist, \"image\" product that can\\'t possibly be worth what it costs. And it\\'s easy to convince others of the same thing, whether you\\'ve actually tried illy or not.<br /><br />The truth is illy is really superb coffee, just about the best I\\'ve ever tried. Since I\\'ve started drinking it at home, I\\'ve found I\\'m actually drinking much less coffee overall, because I only know a couple of places that serve illy locally and I just don\\'t feel like bothering with anything else, at least most of the time. The ironic net effect of this is that illy may actually be saving me some money!<br /><br />I don\\'t know if illy will be worth what it costs to you. There are some very good coffee beans sold by Costco for roughly 1/5 the price, much better than anything you can get at Starbucks or Peets. (In fact, if Starbucks or Peets is your idea of really good coffee, stop reading this now. Not because I think you\\'re some tasteless boob, but because those brands are in the very modern, very successful mode of bitter, over-roasted, burned-tasting American coffee and I don\\'t personally care for that. So if you like those brands, you\\'re probably not going to like illy or any coffee that I like. Personally, I like the bottomless cup of Peerless my favorite diner serves much better than Starbucks.)<br /><br />What I do know is that if you like coffee enough to own a decent grinder and other caffeine paraphernalia, you really ought to try illy. In particular, if you like light-medium roasts but find most are just too wimpy, you may just love this stuff.<br /><br />If not, you\\'ll at least have a cute, fussy  little can you can sub-divide some of your Costco walnuts into.

You get four flavors (French, Italian, House, Kona) of K-cups.  All are on the bolder side of the spectrum, but I wouldn\\'t say they were extra-bold.<br /><br />I like coffee with a punch in the morning as I often only have time for one cup before I leave.  The Italian or French are good for that.  They are the boldest of the four flavors included.  Nice flavor, strong, clean coffee taste without a an odd/burned aftertaste.<br /><br />Kona has a typical (to me) Kona flavor.  Nothing super special, but a good cup of coffee!  I do tend to reserve these for my sister as she loves them. :)<br /><br />House is probably the mildest of the bunch.  A good cup for evening use (or second cup of the day) when you don\\'t need that big coffee BANG.<br /><br />I was worried that when Green Mountain took over Tully\\'s K-cup business that I would have have to find another \"go to\" K-cup.

If you don\\'t like that \\'in your face\\' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you.

Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.

I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured \"food\" items.  I really don\\'t think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it\\'s own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don\\'t use any low-fat milk. Or don\\'t add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.',\n",

       " 'I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe\\'s with my daughter Mindy.  I couldn\\'t believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I\\'ve been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they\\'re thicker than other chips, so don\\'t crumble as I\\'m devouring them; they\\'re delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn\\'t beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn\\'t that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I\\'m getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they\\'re hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they\\'re also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.

       " \"If you want to find a good flavor substitute for maple syrup, barley malt, or brown rice syrup, this will do nicely. I use Madhava's agave nectar in my baked goods all the time, and am always pleased with the results. At the time I'm writing this, Amazon was out of stock as a vendor. However, when it was in stock, it was priced well for the 2-pack.<br /><br />Other than baking, I've used it to top waffles, pancakes, and in small doses (1/2 teaspoon) added it to oatmeal. A little goes a long way.<br /><br />Using agave nectar: Use 1/3 to 1/2 less agave nectar than you would another sweetener (depending on your taste and the recipe. Recipes with dried fruit need much less), cut the heat in the oven by 25 degrees F; if there is oil in the recipe, cut it by 1/3 (alternately, use a tablespoon or two of sifted coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid -- just don't use too much or your recipe will be dry). Additionally, when baking, make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients prior to adding it to the dry. Most bakers might already know this, but remember to read recipes first because sugar is typically added with dry ingredients (unless beaten with butter first).<br /><br />Agave nectar does not crystalize like other sugars do, so you won't be able to substitute it for corn syrup in making hard candy. However, I highly recommend it for baking. It makes everything moister.<br /><br />If you are looking for less caramel flavor, you'll need to use the light version of this product (equally good in all applications).\",\n",

       " \"This is pretty good regular style soy sauce.  But it is not super-wonderful-better than any other good quality soy sauce you can buy in an Asian market.  The main value is as a unique gift.<br />  In the Japanese soy sauce world, there are 4 types: regular, mild (usukuchi), for raw fish (sashimi) and light colored.  Bluegrass soy sauce is regular style.  Compared to Kikoman (a good commercial brand that is widely available) Bluegrass starts saltier, is flat in the middle, then ends with a complex & interesting flavor.  Kikoman is less salty initially and has a round, full flavor in the middle.  Doesn't have the complex ending flavors.  For me, the initial saltiness of Bluegrass is a minus and Kikoman's full middle flavor is a plus.  I prefere Kikoman, especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct.  But I lived in Japan for many years and am used to the standard Japanese flavor.  I haven't tried Bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor, which is how soy sauce is usually used.<br />  Bluegrass is a perfectly good soy sauce.  Each brand has a different flavor and everyone has their favorite.  If you want a unique Kentucky gift for an Asian friend, this is different than the standard bottle of Bourbon or box of chocolate.\",\n",

       " 'MY QUESTION FOLLOWED BY THEIR REPLY - VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!<br /><br />Hey guys,<br />So we are trying to feed a new born as much breast milk as we can, however there is not enough to meet his nutritional needs.<br />So a formula is in order as a supplement. With that, we are interested in your toddler formula, and it appears that since this meets the FDA Infant Formula Guidelines, that it should be safe, (and opinions on the Internet seem to feel the same way). However, our doctor says that it should not be used because of the higher amounts of calcium and phosphorous. He was also concerned about using the DHA/ARA supplement with concerns about the egg white process and that the proteins in egg whites are not good for an infant. Any thoughts on this? Thanks!<br /><br />THEIR ANSWER<br /><br />Dear Dave,<br /><br />Thank you for contacting Nature\\'s OneÂ®.  Firstly, you are correct in that our Baby\\'s Only OrganicÂ® formulas meet the nutritional requirements of the FDA\\'s Infant Formula Act. No dilution is needed for babies under 12 months of age. Please follow label mixing instructions.<br /><br />Regarding the calcium and phosphorous content in Baby\\'s Only OrganicÂ® formulas, calcium is an essential nutrient needed for bone health. The American Academy of Pediatrics Expert Panel for Nutrient Levels in Infant Formula has provided recommendations on the amount of calcium with the minimum per 100 Calories being 50 milligrams and the maximum being 140 milligrams per 100 Calories. Phosphorus is another important mineral for bone health. The Expert Panel has also recommended that the calcium to phosphorus ratio in an infant formula be no less than 1.1 or more than 2.0. Baby\\'s Only OrganicÂ® falls within these ranges with our calcium at 135 milligrams per 100 Calories and a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.5.<br />Reference: Committee on Nutrition, Pediatric Nutrition Handbook, The American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009, pages 1245-1246.<br /><br />The balance between calcium and phosphorus is most important for bone development. The calcium to phosphorus ratio in both Baby\\'s Only OrganicÂ® formula and Enfamil NextStep is 1:5. Thus, Baby\\'s Only OrganicÂ® formulas provide an appropriate ratio of calcium and phosphorus for toddlers and an appropriate overall quantity of calcium and phosphorus.<br /><br />Regarding our Baby\\'s Only EssentialsÂ® DHA/ARA supplement, The DHA utilized in our Baby\\'s Only EssentialsÂ® DHA & ARA supplement is sourced from egg yolk phospholipids. You are probably aware that most often an egg allergy is caused by the egg white rather than the yolk. Additionally, it is the protein component of foods that usually elicit an allergic reaction. Because we use the phospholipids (not protein) from the egg yolk, there is only a very minute chance that an allergic response will ensue.<br /><br />If your child has a history of allergies, we highly recommend that you consult your child\\'s healthcare provider.<br /><br />DHA is also found naturally in other foods, including oily fish like trout, sardines, tuna and salmon and the yolk of eggs. Dietary ARA is available from animal meats, dairy foods, eggs, peanuts and nori seaweed. As your child increases the variety of foods in her diet, you can include some of these foods in her diet. Other natural sources of DHA would include fish oil or fish oil supplements. Unfortunately, it is difficult to insure that these are free from mercury or other environmental toxins. But, also remember that these fatty acids can be formed from dietary linoleic and linolenic acids (nuts, seeds, grains legumes, vegetables and their cold-pressed oils). By including good sources of high quality fats in the diet, your child will easily be able to meet her specific needs<br /><br />Most egg allergies are a result of ingestion of egg white; egg yolk allergies are rare.<br /><br />Proteins are the component of foods that cause allergic reactions. Egg allergy is usually due to the proteins in the egg white. These protein allergens are: ovomucoid, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin; lysozyme, and ovomucin.<br /><br />However, there can be a rare situation of egg yolk allergy. The literature to date usually associates egg yolk allergy to a reaction triggered by inhaled bird allergen, referred to as Bird-egg syndrome. This is a very rare syndrome.<br /><br />Egg allergy can also be seasonal. Oak pollen, short and western ragweed and the goosefoot family of weeds may cross react with eggs when these pollens are in season.<br /><br />The estimated point prevalence of egg allergy in children is 1.6% by 2.5 years of age. (1) Again, egg white is usually the cause of an egg allergy. Most children outgrow an allergy to eggs by 5 years of age.<br /><br /> (1) Eggesbo M, Botten G, Halvorsen R, Magnus P, \"The prevalence of allergy to egg: a population-based study in young children,\" Allergy 56; 5:403<br /><br />I hope this information is helpful to you.

(I believe that with a dogs sense of smell they KNOW exactly what is in their food; however they have no choice but to eat what we feed them...just Google what is in most commercial dog foods, and you'll see why your dog may not be thrilled to eat it up...if a dog can detect cancer in a person, they can detect all sorts of other things that aren't supposed to be eaten.) Anyway...I used to feed Purina lamb and rice to my dogs, but I was finding my young Porty was having trouble with it, and my 15 yr old would eat a few bits and then leave her dish. So, I started making their food, and came up with a wonderfully nutritious and tasty recipe. The dogs loved my homemade dog food, and my 15 yr old began putting on weight again, but I didn't always have time to make their food. And, homemade dog food is kind of hard on the wallet. So, I started to research all the natural dog foods out there, compare costs etc. I arrived on Harmony Farms, and guess what...my dogs LOVE it just as much as they love my home made dog food. My young Porty no longer has stomach troubles and she looks great; my 15 yr old finishes her meals and looks for more. Both have shiny coats and energy. No one can believe my old girl is 15 years old. I have told my friends about Harmony Farms dog food, and when they've switched over, they've reported similar positive results. My brother-in-law's dog had always been a very fussy eater, and had skin problems with a thinning coat. When they started to feed her Harmony Farms, she became an eager eater, more happy and outgoing, and her skin and coat condition has completely cleared up (...I'm thinking she had an allergy to whatever was in her other food, which I think was Iams). Other friends have commented on how happy their dogs are at meal time now...and they had all been feeding their dogs premium, top of the line dogs foods AND paying top of the line prices. Harmony Farms products are very reasonably priced. Not the cheapest dog food on the shelf, but, in my opinion, you are buying the best quality food on the market, so it's an incredibly GOOD DEAL! It may also mean you make fewer trips to the veterinarian's office. I and my friends are so happy we have found this food for our dogs. :)\",\n",

The flavors themselves are a bit bolder than you would expect from a chip. For me this was a good thing. I would have to say the bbq is my favorite. The flavor reminded me a lot of lays bqq but a bolder version of it, the sweet bqq flavor with a bold kick at the end. My bags had very few broken chips in them. Everything about this order was great.<br /><br />My father was around when I was trying my first bag, making fun of them cause they were healthy. I offered him one and he accepted probably to do some dramatic spitting it out and eww effect. He looked at me confused once he ate it, promptly took the bag out of my hand and walked away with it. This is a man who HATES anything healthy, but shows how good the flavors are.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying these again.\",\n",

This is why they are slightly expensive. Similar to kettle chips packaging. You will have fun opening the bags with a POP. Packaging was great. I\\'ve eaten about 6 of the small bags and not one was even slightly damaged.<br />-Taste and Texture: They are about the size of half-dollar coins, kind of puffy like a pork rind or rice cake, and they are not crunchy hard like potato chips but they do crunch. Definitely distinctive and they deserve a place on the market.<br />-Nutrition: 100 Calories! Unfortunately, you know what this means. It\\'s not a big grab by any means. It\\'s about 15-20 chips per .8 oz bag. Which, honestly, is great for portion control. It\\'s probably all we need and popchips knows it. Definitely more filling than other 100 calorie snacks made by, say, SnackWell or the oreos/mini muffins type.<br />-Flavor: The 3 pack comes with Cheddar Potato, Sea Salt and Vinegar, and Barbecue Potato. As an English major I\\'m inclined to take the \"potato\" off the label. Just as salty and flavorful as normal chips, but not overpowering like some (cheap tortilla chips/some doritos).

It's frustrating. I can taste the stuff, and I really dislike it. I also don't like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but I won't go into that here (just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run).<br /><br />There's one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a K-Cup, and that's Swiss Miss. Unfortunately, the Swiss Miss K-Cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find.<br /><br />My opinion? It's probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your Keurig. It's not worth the K-Cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. Spending more than seventy-five cents per cup of water-based hot cocoa is about the limit for me.<br /><br />So, if you're into sucralose/Splenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not-sugar flavor. If you're like me, though, and can't stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option.<br /><br />Three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. Minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I just found out that the Swiss Miss K-Cups also use sucralose. So really, your only choice is to get packets and use your Keurig as a hot water dispenser. How disappointing.<br /><br />UPDATE 02/12: After some research, I found that there is one K-Cup hot cocoa that doesn't have sucralose; However, it is loaded with fructose instead (not the greatest trade-off, since it tastes different from sugar/sucrose, in my opinion) and has no actual sugar/sucrose in it. That one is Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa. Unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor (probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil) and is on the salty side, so I have avoided it. It's also more expensive per-cup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty-five cents (as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars) then go ahead and try it. I will refrain at this point and stick to using packets.<br /><br />I would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa K-Cups, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K-Cups, and Grove Square Hot Cocoa K-Cups ALL use sucralose. Yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is IN ADDITION TO sucralose/Splenda, and not by itself.<br /><br />So your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. None of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant.<br /><br />43 servings of sugar-sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and it's no more complicated than a K-Cup if you know how to operate a spoon.\",\n",

Yes, it is no doubt cheaper to go some other route, that's why 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />But the taste is what you want to know about, right?  The Dark Chocolate flavor is fairly robust with little 'grittyness' to it.  Plop a marshmallow in the cup before brewing and you'll have a real treat!  It comes out strong enough on either the 6 oz or 10 oz setting of the brewer.  Not surprisingly, the milk chocolate flavor is not as strong and a little smoother.  Marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too.  So, maybe a few mini-marshmallows instead of a full-sized one for this flavor.  Oh, and definitely go 6 oz cup.  My oldest granddaughter and I contest for the peppermint chocolate.  She wins, of course, but it's pretty good when I can get one.  No marshmallow needed.  The hint of peppermint is just enough.  6 oz cup on this one is the best way to go, too.<br /><br />I think I got the cups sizes right.  If I didn't, you'll figure it out.

In comparison to other more expensive brands it's a great bargain without sacrificing quality over quantity.<br /><br />Flavor wise: My kids love it, and have already asked me to purchase more. My daughter says that the peppermint is right on and not too weak even if using a larger cup.

Masterpiece chips, but they\\'ve got to be killing me slowly, right?  So I busted open the BBQ soy crisps and gagged.  How could this be BBQ?

I\\'d eat two or three here and there, and when I ran out, I bought 2 bags of the Sea Salt flavor again.  What happened must be akin to rebooting your computer or defragging your hard drive--my body forgot what those strong BBQ flavored chips were like, and I started craving Soy Crisps.  I began to taste a delicious roasted soybean flavor, like those roasted and salted soy beans they sell in jars, which I had completely missed before, apparently because it wasn\\'t a sweet, red-crusted, overbearing BBQ powder.  I polished the next bags off in three days.<br /><br />Now, I\\'m ordering 12 here on Amazon ($1 cheaper per bag than my local grocery store which seems to want to punish my wallet for trying to eat healthy food).  My advice is this--give these soy crisps a chance, but don\\'t mix them in with your regular Doritos and BBQ Ruffles or you\\'ll think they\\'re awful.  Stop eating, for a month, the oily BBQ chips that have deadened your taste buds for years and reboot your taste buds with these markedly healthier chips.  You\\'ll feel better about snacking!',\n",

Well, actually, I did pick up an open box unit that didn't work because they couldn't provide me with the external power supply, so I took it back and got the Icicle as a quick fix that would get me where I needed to go in a timely manner.<br /><br />Hardware: iMac, dual core 2.0 GHz processor and 4 GB or RAM. OS 10.5.8.<br />Software: Garage Band.<br />Mic: Shure SM57.<br /><br />Pros. For recording trumpet with an SM57 it was perfect. Clear sound, low noise, LOTS of signal. With the gain a little over half way on the Icicle and about 58% in Garage Band I got hot horn lines with gain to spare.  Any hotter and they would have started clipping, so it definitely gave enough signal to get the job done.<br /><br />Cons. The gain knob has no dial or indicators for how far you have turned it - it has to be done by feel making it almost impossible to duplicate your settings exactly. This could be improved with a knob with an arrow and a marked dial so you can see where it's set. It also feels a bit cheap - it's lightweight and feels almost fragile. Treated with care it's fine, but I doubt it would take much abuse before it would break and I have been ultra careful with it because it feels so lightweight and cheap.  I also used it as recommended in the accompanying literature and didn't plug it directly into the back of the mic - I used it with a mic cable.<br /><br />For what I needed it was perfect - simple plug and play that got good sound into my computer, and it worked well in a pinch.  I just wish it was a little higher quality in terms of construction.  A bit heavier and a better dial for the analog gain, and I would have rated it a full 5 stars but as it is, I can at best give it 4.\",\n",

For most of my Shepards life I fed her a well known, vet recommended food, and yet she always had stomach problems.  Trying many things, it was not until I rescued, and I should really say she rescued me, and the dog food recall, that I began doing research on brands of food.  After a long investigation, I decided on Newman's Own, not only because there had been no recall on the food, but because of the ingredients, and that the proceeds going to charity. Now, choosing this brand, would mean that I would have to order it online, because my local stores did not carry it, but that was all right with me, because not only do I enjoy online ordering, but I am an older, disabled woman, and getting to the store and hauling in packages is very hard for me.  Well, I want to tell you, My 11 year old thrives on this food, with no more digestive issues, and a beautiful white coat, and she loves eating it with vigor. My two year old American Pit Bull Terrier, another love of my life, also thrives on this food, has the most beautiful shiny coat ever, and people say all the time how beautiful her coat is.

It takes time for the taste buds to adjust and not want the artificial ingredients put into most of the food out there.<br /><br />It has been almost a year.  My dog, Molly, is bouncy and healthy and almost allergy free. She gets dry Newman's fed free style, and 4 ounces of Newman's canned every day.  Her weight stays stable at 65 pounds which is perfect for her. Her treats are real meat jerky strips a few times a week.<br /><br />On another note, this diet has made doggy duty much easier.

Then the idea came up that maybe she had chemical sensitivities...so we decided to go organic...all her deals miraculously cleared up once we started the Newman's. However after giving glowing reviews for many years, we now have to concede something has changed...our little Jack's itching returned to the point of drawing blood. It is clear something changed and I believe it clearly is no longer as organic as it once was...we are on the hunt again.

I/D was also more expensive than Newman's at my local vet's office. I have had a ton of issues getting my dog to accept other dog foods in the past. We tried pretty much every brand that you can buy in pet shops and always had problems with my dog scratching or having her ears get bright red. We found out the problem after one of the cases where she almost went into renal failure after eating her Milkbone treats. We needed something organic without a lot of beef in it. While this one does have some bi-product for protein, it doesn't seem to bother my dog at all. She also has normal stools every time which wasn't the case even with the I/D. My dog hated the I/D. She would often leave a good portion of it on the ground or in the bowl and rarely ate it in its entirety. With the Newman's own it is night and day. She scarfs it down in less than a couple minutes and usually eats a bowl in one sitting. It seems like she loves it from the way she eats it.<br /><br />A couple of the reports from reviewers originally scared me about the reports of scratching which was exactly the problem I had with other dog foods. I gave it a try and my husky has never had a problem since and she has been on it for almost three months now. My husky has always had problems with digestive issues and this seems to be one dog food that she likes and does not have problems with.<br /><br />On a side note, I wish Newman's offered a bigger size bag. I have to order these all the time due to the 12.5 pound bag. My husky kills a bag in roughly two weeks due to her size. It still works out being cheaper than the $50 bag of 17 pound I/D I was ordering so I'm still happy with it. Science diet was sending me to the poor house.\",\n",

       " 'Enfamil Premium Lipil Formula is the same as the previous flagship Mead Johnson formula--Enfamil Lipil--except that it has \"prebiotics\" added in.  Our son was on Enfamil Lipil from September 2007-September 2008.  He was breastfed and formula fed during this time.  Our daughter, who is due in January 2010, will also be breastfed and formula fed for her first year of life.  We tried two other formulas with our son--Similac Advance and Parent\\'s Choice.  The Similac was fine but clumped badly.  During the time we experimented with the Parent\\'s Choice formula, my son was consistently troubled by colds and the flu.  I think the Parent\\'s Choice formula lowered his immunity somehow and will never use it again.  I believe that Mead Johnson\\'s decision to use prebiotics is a good one.  Our son had colic/acid reflux in part because his digestive system was not yet populated with the good bacteria for breaking down milk proteins.  He was a lot more comfortable after we started putting a little Culturelle (a probiotic) in his formula in the evening.  And since a lot of our immune system is in our digestive tract, he had fewer sick days after introducing the Culturelle.  Probiotics and prebiotics will also help infants rebound from the negative effects of antibiotics like amoxicillin quicker.<br /><br />Regarding the bpa found in formula can liners, I talked to an Enfamil customer service representative who told me that Mead Johnson now uses cans that are lined with a \"modified polyester\" that is bpa free.  Similac Advance Earlyshield comes in a bpa-free can also (the SimplePac container).<br /><br />Another concern parents have is the cost of formula.  Name brand formulas are expensive!  But if you think about it, you are feeding a human being for about $15 a week (a can usually lasts us 1.5 to 2 weeks).  $15 a week is peanuts compared to what a hungry teenager devours!  And with name brand formulas you are getting the absolute best product available--Bill Gates couldn\\'t buy a better formula than what\\'s on the shelves at Target or Wal-mart.<br /><br />If you are a new parent and feel overwhelmed by the infant formula section of your grocery store (as I was in September 2007), I suggest starting with the flagship formula of either Mead Johnson (Enfamil Premium Lipil), Abbott Laboratories (Similac Advance Earlyshield), or Nestle (Good Start Gentle Plus or Good Start Protect Plus).

The bowls have been licked clean, and while I questioned the whole peas when I saw them, they weren't left in the bowl. The ingredients and quality of the Felidae seems comparable to the Wellness, so unless I find information indicating otherwise (and I've been looking), I think we'll stick with Felidae.\",\n",

       " \"****Latest Update****<br /><br />We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months.  Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best.  It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself.  The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy...  and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well.  All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read the review about BPA in the lids.  I spent some time trying to verify this myself.  A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn't find anything definitive, here's what bothered me:  Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids...  their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question.  The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss.  That's only slightly paraphrased.  Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either...  nothing.  I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents...  something.  Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns...  just say something...  anything.  Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?<br /><br />As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain.  Something, I likely wouldn't have done if I wasn't writing a review.  Their office was closed...  9AM - 7PM est.  Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.<br /><br />***UPDATED (old)****<br />Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  I'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I'm ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer that's readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least.\",\n",

It plays hell with my diabetes but I just love creating some delicious dessert for friends when we have small gatherings.<br /><br />I usually buy vanilla beans in Tijuana, Mexico because I can get good quality at a decent price. By that I mean the beans tend to be supple, shiny, and aromatic. By \"decent price\" I mean it usually costs me around $1.50 to $2.00 per piece.<br /><br />When I saw this half-pound package at such a low price I was skeptical but I figured the $25 would not be a big risk and if they were bad I can always return them. I ordered on Jan 11 and got them Jan 13. Free two-day shipping being another great feature of my Amazon Prime membership which I now believe is an excellent value.<br /><br />The beans are very high quality. They are \"Gourmet Bourbon\" which means about 30% moisture (a good thing) and they are shiny and nicely oily (you want the oily surface as that is one part where a lot of flavor is located. The other part is in the seeds and that is the reason the bean is split and the seeds scrapped when used).  These beans are very fresh as shown by their flexibility (as beans grow old they dry out and get brittle- still usable but not as good).  They come sealed in a vacuum bag and that is inside a zip bag. Even through the double packaging the scent is very noticeable and complex.<br /><br />This is a large quantity of beans. If you are not going to use them rapidly I recommend separating into two or three bean lots and vacuum packing those. For optimal shelf-life I keep mine in a wine refrigerator (it gets cool but not cold) where I keep my 20 or 30 pounds of various chocolates.<br /><br />This is an excellent deal on good quality.

Also, I don't have insurance so I literally put out hundreds a month to try new drugs that didn't help. More importantly, the side effects were sometimes as bad or worse than my symptoms. I have also tried other natural cures that didn't help.<br /><br />Several of my friends suggested I smoke hemp as a natural cure. I'm not against it but I'm not a smoker and I've had professional jobs where I could be tested, anyway. So I thought, let's check Amazon and see what natural hemp products are available.<br /><br />First I tried hemp powder, which I also reviewed if you're interested, and it tasted like sand.

I have tried too many meds for that to even be a possibility, trust me.<br /><br />The one thing I can tell you for certain is within the first week it greatly and noticeably increased my energy levels.

Can I guarantee it will work? No. My aunt and mom tried a couple just one time and they didn't notice any difference. But it has sure worked for me taking it daily. What I can tell you is that you should at least try it. If it doesn't help, just don't buy it again. But it is sure worth a try because it might help you as much as it has me.

       " \"I can't imagine why but it seems that grocery stores have stopped stocking this item. If you haven't tried it you must, it is the best coating mix available and my family keeps asking me to make chicken only with this shake and bake. It has a very different flavor than any BBQ sauce on the market, a flavor all it's own that is really delicious and goes with any side dish. I have made stuffing, mashed potatoes (a favorite) and almost any vegetable to go with it and everyone always has a second helping of chicken.It's perfect for company because it is unique and tastes like something you would cook for a special occasion. I am always afraid that they will stop making it, it really has become a staple in our home and even the most finicky people love it, kids all seem to love it and I love it because it is quick and easy. It's a very unique flavor, I want to say a little sweeter than most BBQ sauces or flavorings but not really sweet , kind of like a honey BBQ but better, that can be used on pork chops as well. There is a plastic bag enclosed to shake it in but I find that more of the mix sticks to the sides and it is very hard to coat the chicken , a lot of wasted mix that way. I put it on a plate a little at a time and add as needed, then I rinse the chicken pieces and kind of lightly roll them on the plate in the coating (shaking a little out of the packet on spots that are not coated) and then place them into a baking pan that I line with foil, it makes clean up much easier after cooking, almost don't need to wash the pan this way.Try to get all the pieces covered especially on the tops because the bottom will come off a little bit from the grease that cooks out of the chicken. Any mix left in the packet I shake on pieces that don't look completely covered and then just on top of all of them. I usually get a package of about 3 or 4 half breasts and a package of 6 thighs and one pack of mix will cover it all if you roll it on a plate. It becomes very sticky when it gets wet so it will stick to the plate, your fingers and of course the chicken pieces. I have also used a little bit of plum jam brushed on the chicken before coating it and thats very good too, but honestly you don't need to add anything it is delicious the way it is. Cook it long enough to get browned and crispy and remove it to a serving dish right away so it doesn't sit in the grease and you will be extremely happy with the results. I would really be interested to hear from someone who has never cooked with this before and see what they think.\",\n",

I will admit to the fact that they are just a little salty, but nothing an ice cold cola or beer of your choice won't fix. As per being tough, I munched down five or six right out of the container as soon as I opened it. I just couldn't stop myself, they were that good. For all that chewing my jaw is none the worse for the wear. So for those of you out there that are real jerky fans, this is definitely worth trying.<br /><br />**Update** I did a little research because I was curious as to why everyone thought this jerky was too salty. I looked up the nutrition facts on all 4 flavors. Both the Original & Peppered contain 650mg of sodium, the Wood Smoked had 570mg, and the Teriyaki has only 440mg of sodium. So if you thought the others were too salty, or are worried about this jerky being too salty, try the teriyaki. I highly recommend it. It's not too salty, just a hint of sweet from the teriyaki, but still nice pepper flavor as well.\",\n",

The goat milk definitely cured her of the constipation, but each can I open seems to be different. Sometimes when I reconsitute it, I know right away that it is going to taste terrible because the smell is so strong. Other cans, I hardly notice it. She will not drink the bad-smelling milk, and when I have tried it, I have nearly vomitted! Majorly salty and gamey tasting.<br />Compared to fresh (Meyenberg from the fridge section of grocery store), well, it really doesn't compare. I have found the fresh to taste sweet, like cream, and then there is a little gamey after-taste, but nothing like the slap-you-in-the-face taste of the powdered. I was hoping to save money with the powdered, but since it is a 50/50 chance she won't drink certain cans, I am really wasting money. I am thinking I will have to stick with the fresh from now on.<br />If anyone has any ideas about what the difference between cans could be, I would love to hear it! I always have prepared it with Britta-filtered water (warmed on the stove) and mixed it up in pyrex, then stored it in a large Ball jar in fridge.

It almost tastes like Swiss Miss cocoa (and while Swiss Miss is not really my idea of great cocoa, for a protein drink mixed with water, that is pretty good!)<br /><br />Summary: This is the best non-whey, non-soy protein I have found, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with soy+whey/dairy sensitivities! I rated this 4 stars, but if you can't have whey, it is definitely a 5-star product.<br /><br />I'm allergic to both whey and soy, which has made finding a good protein supplement quite a pain! I have tried pretty much everything on the market, including a variety of wheat, buckwheat, and brown rice proteins.  If you are looking for the highest quality protein available, you are unfortunately limited to egg, soy, whey, or casein (based upon PDCAAS, the FDA and FAO/WHO's method of determining protein quality), so egg is really preferable to the alternatives.  Fortunately, this is, in terms of consistency, digestibility, and nutritive content (0 fat 0 carbs), and overall flavor, the best of the various proteins I tried.  In case you are wondering, there is no cholesterol in this protein, either.  Texture and overall 'drinkability' are great... I drink it mixed with water with no issues.  Flavor is decent: obviously, none of us are drinking protein powder expecting a gourmet flavor extravaganza.  This protein is decently tasty if you like chocolate (not as good as most whey/casein proteins, but better than almost all non-whey proteins... I tried quite a few of those as well before discovering that I could not tolerate dairy proteins).  Be warned: the vanilla version of this product tastes terrible.  In my opinion, it is barely drinkable.<br /><br />Four stars overall.  If I had no food sensitivities, I might still use this in conjunction with whey protein, but would probably not use it exclusively.<br />Five stars if you can't have whey protein!<br /><br />I hope that this review is helpful!\",\n",

The more water you can remove, the less you\\'ll have to deal with sloppiness when cooking, something the previous reviewer did not like.<br /><br />As for a blank slate on taste, that\\'s exactly what makes tofu great.  It will take on any flavor you want to impart.  Our most common marinade is placing the pressed, cubed tofu in a Ziploc with a mix of soy, honey, and lemon or lime juice.  A quick search online for a marinade will give you ideas (many also include minced garlic, ginger, etc).  You can also purchase a premade marinade, like a teriyaki sauce.  The more liquid the marinade (and the more water removed from pressing), the better it will penetrate the tofu.  Even a half hour in the bag works fine.<br /><br />We saute it right in the pan with the stir fry veggies (add tofu last--it just needs to get warm; or, for a firmer style, you can bake or \"brown\" it separately first) and pour in the remaining marinade as the final sauce (you can thicken with cornstarch if desired).  Handle the tofu cubes gently as they are not firm like most meats, but broken up pieces taste just fine too.<br /><br />Marinated tofu cubes also do well on kebabs with veggies on the grill.<br /><br />Plain tofu \"creams\" well and is often good in a dish that requires thickness.  We\\'ve made chocolate mousse with it as well as scrambling it like eggs.<br /><br />We have great success breading pressed cubes of this tofu just like you would the chicken in a General Tso recipe.  General Tso\\'s Tofu is AWESOME.  The flavor comes from the sauce so you don\\'t need to marinate first.<br /><br />Some people also freeze tofu--generally remove from packaging and press first--to give it a firmer consistency.<br /><br />Tofu is all about how you prepare it.  Most people will NOT like it plain, so don\\'t expect to just dig a fork into it.<br /><br />This particluar product is great because of its all-purpose nature (firm is definitely better than soft for saute, etc) and its shelf life.  I would have given it five stars but the must-be-refrigerated versions packaged in fluid do seem to be firmer.

I haven\\'t tried beer or other things, but sooner or later I will!<br />The best thing I see coming out of this is that I FINALLY don\\'t need to sweeten my tea! I\\'ll just squeeze a lemon in and that will be that.<br />Hmmm... perhaps I can add lemon juice to soda water and it can turn into a new diet soft-drink!! The possibilities are endless!',\n",
       " \"I do reccomend this product, as it is effective and very fun to try. Here are the setbacks: It only lasts around 30 minutes, not 2 hours. I bought these in lieu of the actual berries ($90 vs. $10) so they weren't as potent as I had read about/expected. Nonetheless, they do work! Lemons and limes were delicious!<br />Oh, be sure to move the tablet over the ENTIRE surface of your tounge in order to cover ALL of your taste buds.\",\n",
       " \"Basically these tables change the way you taste acidic things, they will instead taste sweet. Lemons taste like a strong lemonade. Some of you might be thinking, well that's fun and all but how would my lover taste? well, kind of sweet(men and women). Give it a try you'll see. My only complaint is that they made them look so much like a drug that I had to convince some of my more prudish friends that it was just ground fruit.\",\n",
       " \"After dissolving one tab on my tongue, I ate 1/4 of a large lime, and it tasted mostly sweet with just a hint of tartness!  I would have eaten the whole lime but was worried all that acid might upset my stomach.  I didn't notice any difference when I ate parsley, though--the parsley still tasted somewhat bitter to me.  Miracle Berry worked extremely well for me with sour stuff, but not at all as far as I could tell with bitter stuff.<br /><br />Still, well worth the price to experience this amazing transformation in taste.<br /><br />Edit:  I had a craving for blackberries and bought a large container of them from a warehouse-type store.  I planned on eating them all at one sitting, but after one or two I couldn't eat them--they were mostly sour and hardly any sweet.  I remembered that I had some of these tablets left, so I rolled one around on my tongue until it dissolved, and thereafter the blackberries tasted pleasantly sweet, so I was able to finish them all.\",\n",

The vanilla flavor is perfect, not too sweet to be artifical, and not too malted to taste funky.<br />Its velvety smooth and absolutely perfect around the holidays. (although we drink it year 'round.) Like other fans, I order it by the case for myself and my family at home, I take a can or two to work, and usually giving more away as parts of gift baskets and things like that.  Its perfect paired with fresh baked cookies or alone with a good book when you want to snuggle up and feel relaxed.<br />I dont drink coffee, so Im a connesiur of cocoa-type drinks...this stuff is amazing!

You won't regret springing for a case of it.  Makes a terrific gift too. Mmmmmmm......\",\n",

Those prices make me reluctant to use them in most dishes that call for them, and instead I use vanilla bean paste (Williams and Sonoma sells a very good product). But these beans are such a good deal (less than a fifth the supermarket price) that now I'm willing to use them with almost reckless abandon. Vanilla beans really do provide superior flavor to things like rice pudding and custards and vanilla ice cream, a more complex, more luxurious flavor than vanilla extract does. These beans arrived fresh, fragrant, and tightly bagged. They're Madagascar vanilla beans, considered by some cognoscenti to be inferior to Tahitian beans, but not being one of the cognoscenti, I can't detect much difference at all. This product has made me a fan of internet grocery shopping.\",\n",
       " \"I bought the Navitas Naturals Chia seeds.  They are great.  I put them in a shaker bottle.  I use them on sweet potatoes, in salads and coleslaw and just learned that they can replace half of the fat in baking.  At first I didn't know if it was lowering my blood glucose or if it was something else but I confirmed it the other day.  I had stopped using the seeds and my morning blood glucose shot up to the 140's.  I decided to start using the seeds again and within a few days my blood sugars dropped to the 120's and the only thing I changed in my diet was the addition of chia seeds.  I love them.  I haven't made the gel yet I have only used them raw and they are like eating poppy seeds which I love.  Hope this will help other diabetics.  Navitas is a quality product and is very reasonably priced.  I will definitely continue to buy them.\",\n",
       " 'When I found out I was pregnant with my first child, I read in a baby magazine about the wonderful health benefits of Chia seeds. They are packed with Omega-3 fatty acids, and because healthy brain function is nurtured by Omega-3 fatty acids, I wanted to supplement my diet with something other than fish oil pills that can pack a fairly unpleasant aftertaste.<br />These seeds are so tiny, and so flavorless, that you can mix them into cereal, or even juice, without ever realizing you have consumed them. I have also found that adding these seeds to my breakfast keeps me fuller longer.<br />Chia seeds are more convenient than flax seeds, and a pound of them, costing around $12 (depending on the seller), lasts a few months.<br />If you want to avoid the potential unpleasantness of fish oil supplements, Chia seeds are a great alternative, and for new or expecting mothers, they are a great way to ensure your baby is getting what s/he needs for optimum brain health and development.<br />Lastly, you do not have to be considering motherhood to consider adding Chia to your diet. It is a wonderful, all-natural supplement that is perfectly painless (in both taste and cost) to undertake.<br /> Who would have thought that the seeds responsible for the (infamous) \"Chia Pet\" would offer so much more than a gawdy table ornament?<br />Highly recommended.',\n",
       " \"For health reasons, I try to eat highly nutritious low carb foods. I love tapioca but it's 100% carbs with no nutritional value. I was introduced to chia seeds and it is a highly nutritious low carb food but it is also a fun food. It absorbs 12x its weight in liquids and puffs up and reminds me of tapioca with a strawberry seed inside (and that's what it tastes/feels like). Another one of my favorites is the Mexican drink called: Chia fresca, which is basically soaked chia seeds in lemonade. You have to experience it yourself to know why it's so popular.  One lb. added to liquid will create 10-14# of highly nutritious food.<br /><br />Chia seeds (best known for the chia pet) are high in protein, 5x the calcium of milk and high in Omega 3 oils. Chia seeds are seeds of an herb and are grown in Mexico, south & central America and were the food of the Aztecs.<br /><br />I would think you could make faux tapioca pudding with just coconut milk, chia seeds & sweetener, but I don't know how well the chia would absorb the coconut milk since it's so fatty. (Can of coconut milk, 1/4 cup chia seeds & sweetener to taste) I make it with 2 cups of water, 4 scoops of whey protein, then I soak one cup of chia seeds in this and when it has plumped up, I add 2 cans of coconut milk and sweetener. Sometimes I cream a package of cream cheese into a can of pumpkin, cinnamon and add that for more nutrition for a pumpkin pie tapioca pudding.\",\n",
       " \"Chia seeds are a great, healthy food to add to your diet. I make chia gel by mixing them with water (1/2 C. per tablespoon of seeds), then stir the gel into yogurt, oatmeal, smoothies . . . it's flavorless and the seeds have a pleasant crunch. This brand is high quality and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.\",\n",
       " 'These seeds are perfect for tossing into yogurt or smoothie.  But you must consume quickly.  The seeds draw moisture quickly causing them to swell.  You will be picking them from your teeth for days if you do not drink with a staw.  I have taken them straight from a spoon and washed them down with a glass of water before my \"light\" lunch and they really do give a feeling of fullness.  Do to a severe sensitivity to caffeine and any sort of stimulus, I wanted to try something natural that would not raise my pulse, quicken my MVP heart and just not make me overall jittery.  These do the trick.  When I drink a meal replacement drink, I still feel hollow inside and want to snack.  By adding a full, rounded table spoon of seeds after a few minutes, I feel nice and full.  These can be tossed into a powdered drink, a canned ready to go drink (milkshake type) and even into a vitamin water.  But believe me when I say, you must consume quickly or you will need a spoon, they turn into a jello consistency quick....which actually is not bad either.  You can bulk up a 100 calorie pudding snack by stirring in a teaspoon or so.  Many ways to get creative with the Chia seeds.  Enjoy!',\n",

Here are a few to start:<br /><br />*According to studies, Chia possesses the highest percentage of the polyunsaturated fatty acids(linolenic and linoleic) of all crops. Chia seeds contain 60% omega 3 fatty acids.<br /><br />*The protein content of Chia is higher that other nutritional grains. Unlike other grains, it is a complete protein, meaning that it has the appropriate balance of all essential amino acids. About 19 to 23% of chia seeds weight is protein.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are high in fiber, a 15 gm serving of chia seeds will provide 4 to 5 gm of fiber. Our body requires at least 35 gm of fiber a day to stay healthy.<br /><br />*Chia seeds contain boron which is essential for bone health.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are rich in calcium, about 2 oz of chia seeds contains 600 mg of Calcium, as compared to 120 mg for a cup of milk.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 2 times more potassium than banana.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 3 times more antioxidants than blueberries<br /><br />Regardless of the astonishing nutritional values of Chia seeds, it also tastes very good.

Feel free to add a little cinnamon, peanut butter, fruit, or your own oatmeal favorite additions.<br /><br />There are many other recipes for eating Chia, but oatmeal is my personal favorite.

       " 'I was delighted to be able to order these, since local stores no longer carry them.  The bags contain what appear to be chips of pork skin that were parboiled in salt water, then flattened under high pressure.  Be sure to shake them around to distribute them throughout the bag before cooking.  They expand considerably in the bag during 1:00 to 2:00 of nuking, depending on the wattage, etc., but it is a slow expansion, unlike the vigorous popping of corn.  Also, the bag  only expands about half as much as with popcorn.  When ready, these resemble the ones available in cellophane bags that were deep-fried, but these are far tastier, fresher, AND MUCH LOWER IN FAT AND CALORIES.  A whole bag is 210 calories, about 50 calories from fat.  This is less than the low-fat microwave popcorn I use.  One bag, however, has 50% of the daily salt limit for an adult.<br /><br />I especially like these sprinkled with garlic powder and dried marjoram (together).  Other herbs and spices are interesting variations, such as sage or cumin or whatever else might appeal to you.',\n",
       " \"I love it, less than two minutes in the microwave and you have hot, crispy and fresh (key here...some of the already puffed ones in stores are stale) chicharrones, or pork rinds.

They are really yummy and as long as you don't overindulge, you should enjoy them every time you are seeking something crunchy and salty (and low in carbs!).\",\n",

Some bags were saltier than others, but we've cooked up about 5 so far and the majority aren't overly salty.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned watching them to figure out how long the cooking time should be. In our 1100 watt oven 40-43 seconds seems to be just right.<br /><br />The key is to take them out the moment the bag has fully inflated. Leave them in too long and you end up with charcoal and not enough time will make them gummy.<br /><br />Since I follow a fairly low carb regimen for health and weight reasons, I like the fact that these can be a perfect vehicle for guacamole and salsa without the carbs. I'm still trying to come up with more dip ideas that will go well with the flavoring.<br /><br />I wish they'd put out a version that didn't have seasoned salt as I'd like them with just salt and/or garlic.\",\n",

Be careful to even out the contents of the bag before microwaving and to make sure the bag rotates freely in microwaves with a turntable. Microwave time is short, about 90 seconds. They come out hot and fresh tasting. Pieces are relatively small, about an inch square. They have a less intense pork flavor than the best pork rinds, but having them hot helps compensate. Amazingly, pork rinds are becoming \"diet food.\" They have no carbs, there is a lot of air in them that minimizes the calories for the volume, and relatively small quantities are satisfying. Anyway, it is a good story to go with a tasty snack.',\n",

       " 'I don\\'t mean \"good for a gluten free cookie\", or \"almost like a normal cookie\".  No, I mean, that as a cookie they are good.  No strange textures, odd flavors, or smells.  No sticking them in the refrigerator to help out the texture.  They basically taste like a normal crunchy sugar cookie with cinnamon that just happens to be gluten free.  No milk or butter either so I believe they should be casein free also.  According to the labeling they are vegan and kosher as well.<br /><br />That\\'s a mighty impressive list of good stuff.  You\\'re probably wondering what the catch is, right?  It definitely isn\\'t the taste.  As I said at the beginning, these are very, very good.  I only see two drawbacks.<br />1) Cost.  Most gluten free foods are expensive so this one isn\\'t unexpected.<br />2) Quantity.  The 5.25 ounce package contains 16 cookies.<br /><br />16 cookies really doesn\\'t seem like that many, particularly when enjoying them.  However that could be considered a positive attribute for some of us.  I know I have a tendency at times to munch on something yummy without paying attention to how much I am eating only to find I\\'ve eaten the entire bag.  Since the package is a built-in pause / stop point, the smaller size less overeating.  Even so, I still wish there were more in a package.<br /><br />One last note, just because I found it to be unusual.  Normally all the cookies would be packed the same way, i.e. two rows of eight.  These aren\\'t.  Instead, there are two rows of seven cookies each, side by side, and then two more cookies at the end of the package rotated 90 degrees from the others.  There isn\\'t anything wrong with this packaging method since it maximizes usage of the packaging space.  It\\'s just not how most packaged cookies are packaged, nor is it symmetrical, so it sticks out as unusual to me.',\n",

It is tasty, healthful, fresh, and lovingly produced by hand in small batches and according to ages-old methods and principles.<br /><br />I began using this ghee as a part of a transition to eating more healthy, home-cooked foods. More recently, I participated in an Ayurvedic cleanse that required that I take 1/4 cup of plain, warm ghee for several mornings straight! Though this can be an unpleasant experience with ghee of lower quality, the Pure Indian Foods ghee was truly delicious. The flavor is clean and sweet, without any of the harshness or overbearing unctuousness of other ghees (even those labelled as organic). And not a hint of rancidity, to which I'm very sensitive.<br /><br />Only unhomogenized milk is used for this ghee, which is unusual and extremely beneficial.

It has a rich buttery smell, and it seems like they clarify it a little less because it\\'s slightly grainy when you taste it at room temperature.<br /><br />That said, I find myself buying the Purity Farm ghee because this brand is almost twice as expensive and while it has the edge in taste, it is very very slight and not worth the big premium to me. It might be worth it if I was primarily using this at room temperature like on bread, but I usually use regular butter for that, and for cooking you really cannot tell any difference in flavor. There is also a chance I am getting ghee from different times of the year for each brand which does affect the flavor.<br /><br />So in short, amazing high quality ghee, but a bit overshadowed by the much cheaper and also amazing high quality <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046IIPMW\">Purity Farm Organic Ghee, Clarified Butter, 13-Ounce</a> brand ghee.',\n",

       " \"So, I bought the Coffee Pod Drawer thinking it was the answer to my cluttered coffee area on my kitchen counter.  Not exactly.  First and foremost, let me say - this is a great product.  It does hold the pods neatly.  It has a nice, durable, slip resistant top that lets you feel comfortable that your Keurig won't slip or tip over. This is why I gave the product 4 stars.<br />My issue is this:  I purchased this simply because I thought it would use up less space on my counter if my K-Cups were stored inside this drawer and underneath my Keurig, as opposed to my (somewhat) bulky K-Cup Carousel.  (Which by the way, is chrome, and I really despise chrome.)  Anyways, what I did not consider was the fact that it raises your Keurig up by about 3.25 inches.  Before I bought this drawer, my Keurig had just enough space on the counter under the cupboard that it sits under, for me to lift the top of the Keurig open to put new K-Cups in, and to fill the water, etc.  That additional 3.25 inches really makes a difference.  I can no longer open the top of the Keurig all the way without banging the cupboard.  We all know that you don't NEED to open it all of the way, but when that's what you were used to doing, well, you can understand...  I pretty much bang the cupboard every day now.  Another drawback to the idea of purchasing this soley to save space, is that you can't keep anything in front of the drawer, since obviously, you need to open the drawer to get the K-Cups out. I used to keep the coffee condiments in front of my Keurig, and now I can't.<br /><br />Here's the bottom line: This is a great product in the sense that it gets the carousel (if you have one) off your counters.  But, I would only buy this if 1.) You have ample clearance above your Keurig now to be able to still lift the top open once you set this up, and 2.) You don't need to use the space in front of the drawer.<br /><br />Happy Coffee Drinking!<br /><br />Update:  02/20/12:<br />Almost a year later - I am still using the Storage Drawer.  Yes, from time to time I forget and still whack the cupboard, but the Keurig and the cupboard are no worse for the wear.  I still keep my eye out for better storage solutions, and none have really looked like they would be any better.  While the product is well made and has been durable (still looking practically new, and is heavily used in my kitchen) - I still think it's a bit pricey for what it is.  I just checked online and it still ranges from $25 to $45.  (I am hoping that nobody pays $45 for this when you can get it for $24.99, plus use a coupon for 20% off at Bed Bath and Beyond.)<br />Of all the reviews I have written on Amazon, this one seems to bring some not so nice comments from people. Which is kind of odd to me.  But everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I still hold firm at 4 stars.  As I mentioned in a reply to one comment - to me, that's a B+. There's nothing wrong with a B+ product.  I think most people that buy this product will be very impressed with it's durability.  Thanks for reading!\",\n",

The reasons for this are multiple: California's Sardine processing crashed after overfishing of California Sardines ruined the industry in CA for a while.

I haven\\'t quite made the transition to totally raw and I don\\'t think I ever will but this is the next best thing.<br /><br />Price is not comparable to the price of your health. Most don\\'t know how to measure that. The way I watch people waste their money on things like eating out, booze and claim they save money to buy one dollar microwaveable meals doesn\\'t compare. Those \"frugal\" individuals suffer long term when they get older. They are the same people that poke fun at folks like me who take supplements and do yoga. I see a long term investment that most people tend to neglect: YOUR BODY! Your health needs to balance on ALL levels: mind and body.

And it is also good for those of us who need to avoid the estrogenic properties of ingesting too many soy products.<br /><br />Great, so it's healthy, but how does it taste?

However, the high amount of fiber might present a problem for those coming straight from a SAD (standard American diet), so you might want to begin slow with a small drink and work up to the full dose.<br /><br />In fact, I'm drinking a Nutiva Hempshake smoothie right now for my breakfast.

My son has autism and according to his IgE and IgG panel test he has about 20 food sources that he has to avoid, such as: gluten (wheat, barley, rye), oats, milk, garlic, walnuts, sesame, grapefruit, coconut, and so on. I myself am sensitive to gluten and dairy and would get bloated and heartburn if I consume gluten or dairy. So this may not be the fault of this product because I found it to be a great product. I suggest if you have any GI issues you check with a good GI doctor, not just ANY GI doctor. The best GI doctor in the world is Dr. Arthur Krigsman. He practices either at Throughtful House in TX or in NYC. He has helped so many children with autism and addressed their GI issues that eventually the autistic behaviors improve. My son has been treated using simiar protocols by our DAN! doctor, Dr. Neubrander in NJ, and has recovered from autism just by cleaning his GI problems.<br /><br />I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish it would not use sugar. It uses sugar cane, but natural sugar or not it's still sugar. Sugar feeds yeast, and yeast causes GI and neurological issues (definitely behavior issues with my son). Signs of yeast overgrowth: dark circles under the eyes, red cheeks/ears, rashes/ezcema, hyperactivity, fatigue, craving for carbs and sugar, and so on (check out SCD diet on the Internet). I would rather use Stevia or Xylitol, so I wish this product didn't come sweetened. Xylitol actually has an added benefit, to prevent and fight cavities, since we don't use fluoride at home (fluoride is toxic, and it binds to calcium but it can't tell the difference between calcium and lead, so it increases metal retention in your body).

I found these at my local Asian mart for about $2.00.<br /><br />First you must rinse these noodles well because the liquid they come in smells like a lake (you should prepare yourself for the smell). Second, you need to lay out the noodles on paper towels and press down removing as much of the liquid as possible before use.<br /><br />Next I fried them on high heat with a small amount of oil and butter. After a few minutes I then added my frozen stir-fry vegetable medley. I then added some broth, soy sauce, and finally a thickener such as corn starch. Stir it up, bring to a boil, and turn it off.<br /><br />Really it tasted great- very much like the ramen noodles.  It is important to note that the noodles themselves have \"no flavor\" and actually absorb the flavor of whatever ingredients you are cooking them in. So let them sit it whatever flavor suits you.',\n",
       " \"I first heard about Shirataki noodles years ago and decided I would try it.  I went to Fiesta and got these Tofu Shirataki Noodle.  Shirataki are made from Konjac yams and the added tofu gives it a harder texture. The noodles without tofu added is 0 calories.  The one with tofu is 20 cal per 4 oz which is low in cal. I always rinse the noodles first. I never cook it longer than 3 minutes. The first time I ever made Shirataki Noodles I cooked it like regular pasta and it turned into a gel--this was years ago. I learned that was the worst mistake to make and changed how I make these noodles. The next time I made it correctly and tried to eat it with pasta sauce. That didn't work for me, since the flavors did not merry and I was accustomed to the hard texture of pasta. The noodles are similar to the texture of vermicelli rice noodles. I personally prefer it in soups and not as a substitute for spaghetti.  I would sometimes eat it with a sauce I make with soy sauce, shredded ginger, chili paste, and sprinkle green onions on top for looks.  I have tried this rinsed without it being cooked and it has no flavor whatsoever.  It isn't like Ramen noodles which as a flavor without anything added.  Even though I still eat the Tofu Shirataki, I just got the one without tofu and it is very similar.  The one without tofu is 0 cal which is a plus.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I did some more research on Shirataki noodles in order to expand my ideas with recipes.  I found that the reason that my shirataki noodles may have turned into mush was because it expired.  It seems Shirataki noodles is still good for a year and even after it is still edible however it would turn to mush if cooked too long.  These noodles also apparently shrink and become thinner, something it seems some people like.  I went to the store that I used to get my Tofu Shirataki noodles, and looked at the for an expiration date.  Lo and behold, it was expired by over a year.  I even saw some in the store expired by over 2 years.  It seems that non expired shirataki noodles will become alot more chewy if cooked too long.  My mom used it in stir fry, and I have also tried it baked which is also a great idea.  I been lazy and not just use any boullion cube with the noodles and that works fine...I just let it sit in the seasoning for a few hours to take the flavor of the soup.\",\n",
       " \"I tried both these and just the plain shirataki noodles with zero calories purchased at my local Asian market and I prefer these the best. The plain Shirataki feel like a noodle shaped gummie candy when you eat them...not as hard but too 'slippery'..The House Brand with tofu didn't have that same 'slippery' taste. I didnt find preperation to be that bothersome as a couple of posters have mentioned. I just open them and pour them in a strainer and let the water run over them throughly, flipping them once or twice to get them rinsed well then I toss them in a pan of boiling water for about 15 seconds (they're already cooked) drain and season them however I wish. They have been a great addition to my low calorie diet. I just tried them last night with a packet of seasoning from a box of Suddenly Salad (classic) and I was in heaven...40 calories for the WHOLE bag!\",\n",
       " \"I agree with the other reviewer, the preparation alone with these noodles would cause me to give them fewer then five stars. However, if they tasted like regular pasta with only 40 calories a bag, I could deal. Unfortunately, they are disgusting. I am a big fan of the cookbook author/food blogger Hungry Girl, and she uses these all the time so I had to try them. Needless to say I was very disappointed. They were very chewy (she told her fans this, so I was prepared for it), smelled nauseating when I opened the bag (rotting vegetables or fish smell maybe?), and had a bizarre taste. Regular pasta just kind of works as a texture filler for dishes, but these noodles had a strong and weird, chalky flavor. I will NEVER, EVER buy them again and will just settle for eating pasta dishes made with whole wheat noodles only once in a while. If you still feel the need to try them, I'd recommend buying only one bag until you know whether or not they are for you.\",\n",

The difference in grades and colors is based on which part of the short maple harvesting season the syrup is gathered in: Grade A dark amber comes in the heart of the season, later than the early-season lighter syrups, and before the trees are really warming up, when the baking-quality Grade B is harvested.\",\n",
       " 'This is the first time I have tried an organic maple syrup.  Being a Grade A Dark Amber already promised great taste, but being organic added to the expectations.  The product has surpassed what I expected, with the warm, mellow taste that reminds me of northern woods, campfires, and the tingle of frost in the air.  After being raised on the authentic flavor of real maple syrup, artificial syrups are a big disappointment; this product enlivened the taste of my Saturday morning pancakes.',\n",

Mind you, it would take two of these to fill me like a clif bar does.<br /><br />It's about 2/3rd's the size of a clif bar, it's loaded with oats (this is the first thing you taste) and chocolate chips (which is about the last thing you taste). They are moist and chewy like a soft cookie. About a medium sweetness compared to a regular cookie.<br /><br />Per bar: calories (180), fat (9 gr), carbs (23 gr), fiber (2 gr), and protein (2 gr).<br /><br />Ingredients: GF oats, organic agave, brown rice flour, white rice flour, sweet rice flour, tapioca starch, xanthan gum, organic chocolate chunks (organic natural evaporated can sugar, organic cocoa paste, organic cocoa butter, non-GMO soy lecithin/emulsifier, gluten-free organic vanilla) coconut sugar, monounsaturated safflower oil, organic eggs, almonds, coconut, chia seeds, natural flavors, sea salt, baking soda, xanthan gum.<br /><br />They do note on the packaging that there may be traces of milk, nuts, peanuts or soy because of what they're processed on.<br /><br />Overall, they're pretty darn good.

Everybody\\'s needs are different, but this product is just outside my range of what I consider a \"healthy snack\".<br /><br />Most of the ingredients are \"organic\", which is a plus.

Perhaps it\\'s the chocolate, or one of the other sweetening ingredients, but by the time I finish the bar, I\\'m reaching for something to drink to cut the sweetness. The benefit of this is that the bar is a good candy-substitute if you are craving a sweet treat in the afternoon hours.<br /><br />The texture is good -- this bar is like a heavy oatmeal cookie.

I stopped buying the baked cheese puffs from the same brand because the quality varies from one batch (by the expiration date) to another, and the last batch had too many puffs without cheese. Back to the curls, the previous batch (November) was just excellent (good flavor and crispiness as reported by my wife), but then came the one I bought just a week ago...there is not a single curl with proper cheese flavor in the bags. So why not complain? I am complaining, but the company doesn\\'t care. I told them last year that the quality of the puffs varied from one batch to another, and it only got worse. The retail price has increased to $2.95 since then. At that price I expect a very good product, especially when I buy 12 at a time.

As a pudding-fan, I am deeply saddened that several, rather puerile, reviewers find this name mildly amusing.

It is nice enough, and is especially good with English-style custard.  It is tasty, filling and easy to prepare, and its name makes it great fun.<br /><br />But if you are a fan of the Aubrey/Maturin stories and want to eat like them, be warned that this is not the real thing.

Straying from the typical rubbage on British plates, the injection of flavor from Spotted Dick is a welcome taste.

That's roughly 1000 calories with about 360 of them fat calories for a total of 40 grams of fat.  To say that this Dick is fat would be an understatement.

I use a whisk and it comes out delicious. I think this is one of the best products Nestle makes and about the only one I consistently purchase.

       " 'If you do some research on natural sweeteners with a zero glycemic index, you will see that Erythritol is one of the best.  It is a sugar alcohol found in various fruits and vegetables like Xylitol.  But unlike Xylitol, it is not dangerously toxic to dogs and does not have bloating, gaseous effects.  If you don\\'t need a sweetener without blood sugar effects, you can look at brown rice syrup or agave, since they have a very low effect on blood sugar.  If you want no blood sugar effects at all, I\\'d recommend this, since it has a very nice taste (like sugar) with no aftertaste.  Stevia is another option, but is very strong and has a less appealing taste.  If you use even a bit too much, Stevia generally has a rather bitter aftertaste.  This is not true of Erythritol.<br /><br />I would say the only downside is the cost and that it is only 70% as sweet as sugar.  You can spike it with Stevia to make up the difference if you like Stevia.  It doesn\\'t take much to add to get it a lot sweeter.  You should shake it up really well before using, though.<br /><br />Note: If you want to buy this particular item, I discovered that this company has not charged me extra shipping for more bags going to the same address. I would avoid EmeraldForest, though, because the Erythritol I got from them had a very strange, foul smell -- like mothballs -- and had a faint aftertaste that was the same. Their customer service was very nasty when I called to return it, in spite of their \"100% satisfaction guarantee\". I am sticking with Now Foods from now on.<br /><br />Also:  It is a bit misleading that they call this particular item \"powdered\".  Regular powdered sugar is pulverized and has cornstarch added to give it that silky feel, as well as calcium phosphate to improve its flowing ability.  What they mean here, though, is that it is a much finer grain than their regular erythritol.  It is still a grain, however.  I buy it because it dissolves faster than the larger crystals, but both are good products.',\n",
       " \"Now Foods' erythritol is a sugar substitute made from corn. By fermenting the corn's sugars, the manufacturer produces a naturally-occurring sugar alcohol product. Sugar alcohols taste exactly like sugar, but without the calories and blood sugar spike. And they are alcohols in chemistry terms only, not to be confused with the kind of alcohol one finds in adult beverages.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* Tastes just like sugar and has no unpleasant aftertastes, unlike stevia.<br /><br />* Has a glycemic index of zero. Great for diabetics or those simply wishing to eliminate excess sugar from their diets.<br /><br />* Contains virtually no calories.<br /><br />* Made by a manufacturer committed to a wide range of sweeteners and food products, so the company is experienced and trusted in its field.<br /><br />* Erythritol occurs naturally in many foods. The FDA recognizes it as a viable and safe sugar substitute. Erythritol-based sweeteners have been on the market in other countries for years.<br /><br />* Unlike some other sugar alcohols such as xylitol, mannitol, and sorbitol, it will not cause gas if consumed in large amounts.<br /><br />* Not only does erythritol not promote tooth decay, it actually prevents it, inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria in the mouth.<br /><br />* Can be used in baking.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />* Not quite as sweet as sugar. You need about a quarter to a third more erythritol by volume for an equivalent.<br /><br />* Though it tastes exactly like sugar, erythritol has a slight, mint-like, cooling effect on the tongue. In foods where that effect would be undesirable, erythritol would need to be combined with another sweetener to diminish the effect. (This effect seems to vary from person to person, too.)<br /><br />* In some clear liquids such as tea, adding erythritol will initially cloud the liquid, though the cloudiness fades quickly. (That issue probably comes from the release of oxygen bubbles as the product dissolves.)<br /><br />* Though it dissolves, erythritol does not do so as rapidly as sugar. It will retain its granularity in some foods. (Some people recommended powdering it to compensate.)<br /><br />* Because it involves more steps to make than corn syrup or sugar, this is not a cheap product. Perhaps in the future, economies of scale will drive the price down.<br /><br />Many companies are discovering the benefits of erythritol as a natural sugar substitute that lacks the nagging questions that dog artificial sweeteners like sucralose and aspartame. Now Foods' erythritol is one of the best values in this natural sweetener on the market, available at a much lower price point than some competitors' products. Though not cheap compared with sugar or some artificial sweeteners, as a healthy alternative, it more than makes up for its higher cost.<br /><br />Definitely recommended.\",\n",

       " '\"Erythritol\" has become our sugar substitute of choice since I became diabetic a few months ago. In crystal form, it seems about 70% as sweet as regular sugar. My wife uses a little bit of added sugar to bring the sweetness up for the rest of the family in things that need it, but I am happy with it as a one-to-one replacement for sugar in most things.<br /><br />I have not noticed any glycemic impact to my blood sugar or \"laxative\" effects seen with other sugar alcohol sweeteners (which is a very important consideration :-)<br /><br />Highly recommended!',\n",
       " \"Erythritol tastes like sugar, just like xylitol.  It is not, however, toxic to pets as xylitol is.  Also, it does not have the gastrointestinal effects (bloating, gas, etc.) that can come with intake of large quantities, as is the case with xylitol.  Both are quite safe for people, however.  Dogs cannot eat chocolate, either, due to toxicity, so xylitol is just another thing that works for us but not for them.  But erythritol is safe for both people and animals.<br /><br />The downside to erythritol is that it costs more than xylitol and is only 70% as sweet as sugar, whereas xylitol is closer to being the same sweetness as sugar.<br /><br />I haven't had much luck baking with either of them -- but maybe others have had different experiences.<br /><br />Both xylitol and erythritol taste great - I can't tell them from sugar.  Stevia is also a healthy sugar alternative, but it definitely has a taste -- not pleasant in large amounts (bitter).<br /><br />Not all brands of xylitol and erythritol are equal.  Many come from birch trees which often is extracted using sulfuric acid.  The ones from NOW Foods are from corn, which does not require sulfuric acid.<br /><br />This is a good company and I have been very happy with them.  On the other hand, I did not have a good experience with Emerald Forest's products or customer service.  Their products come from birch trees and have a very unpleasant odor.  I much preferred the products from this company - they taste great and don't really have an odor.\",\n",

If someone in the house balks at the taste, you can toss in a dash of fine sea salt or honey (agave works well too). You could easily mix PB2 with PB to wean onto this gradually.<br /><br />TEXTURE: Mixes fast and is very smooth (surprisingly). From the jar, it\\'s similar in consistency to powdered sugar. Open factory seal on jar carefully so it doesn\\'t fly out (trust me).<br /><br />MIXING: Easily mixes using a small spoon or spatula in a gently sloping small bowl (I use a pinch bowl)<br /><br />USAGE: PB2 has recipes on their website (Bell Plantation) and they also sell a chocolate/pb product. I\\'m a fan of straight PB2 (a spoon by itself) but have had PB2 on crackers, sprinkled on banana/apple slices, and am looking forward to making homemade PB2 ice cream this summer.<br /><br />STORAGE: I was a bit disappointed at shelf life projection.

I havent tried mixing it w/ jelly or honey or anything else, as some others have suggested; the whole reason I bought this was because I wanted a lower calorie, lower fat alternative to regular peanut butter, so for me, mixing it with 150 calories worth of jelly doesnt make any sense.<br /><br />In any case, this is definitely NOT exactly like regular peanut butter.. the consistency is a little different, but I suppose you could adjust that to your own liking by adding more or less water. Also, you can definitely tell that this is a lower fat product than regular peanut butter; I mean, when you take a tablespoon of regular peanut butter, you can instantly taste and sense the richness due to the fat content, and when you eat PB2, you definitely notice the difference. Thats not necessarily a bad thing, just different. Its almost the same as if you are used to eating super premium, high fat ice cream, and then one day you switch to low fat; the low fat may still taste very good, but because you are so used to eating the high fat stuff, you will instantly notice a difference-- however, once you get used to it, it wont bother you.<br /><br />I would say PB2 is the same... its definitely NOT the exact same taste / texture as regular peanut butter, but its still very good. it has a very fresh, \"clean\" taste. in my opinion, its DEFINITELY worth the compromise, considering the huge amount of fat and calories in regular peanut butter, and how much healthier PB2 is in comparison . I have cravings for peanut butter just about every day, but up to now, I have only allowed myself to eat regular peanut butter about once a week, due to the fat and calorie content...  but now, since finding PB2, I allow myself to have it whenever I want it.<br /><br />By the way.. I tried the PB2 Chocolate version-- I ordered a sample from their website-- it was OK.. not fabulous, not bad. to me, if I am going to really \"go for it\" and eat chocolate peanut butter anything, its not going to be a low fat version, because its just not worth it. in other words, if I had a craving for a Reeses peanut butter cup, chocolate PB2 would not satisfy that craving. On the other hand, when I have craving for regular peanut butter-- in a sandwich or right off of a spoon, regular PB2 will satisfy that craving without wrecking my diet. Bottom line: if you arent sure whether or not you will like this product, go to the Bell Plantation website and spend the four bucks and order a sample, and give it a try, then you will know for sure before you commit to buying 4 jars plus shipping. ( and folks, the shipping costs almost as much as the 4 jars, so make sure you like this before you order it! )<br /><br />My final verdict is I am pretty sure I will be replacing regular peanut butter with PB2 for as long as they keep making it, and will probably order it by the case in the future to save on shipping.',\n",

I did this one year - we had them everywhere, in all our food, on the walls, and it was disgusting.  If you already have an infestation, try lowering the frequency of your waterings - your plants won't get dehydrated from a little less if the gnats have been happy with what they've had.

That is not the case with La Tourangelle. I was contacted by Diane through email about a week later asking for the batch numbers. I gave them and didn't hear anything back, until today. About an hour ago UPS delivered a box that contained two large cans of oil; one can of Avocado oil and one can of Hazelnut oil. I was so surprised because I didn't even remember giving them my address, but now recall it was required on their email submission form. At any rate La Tourangelle went above and beyond and they will be getting my business in the future, but only in a B&M store or through their website. That is the only place I can recommend anyone buy these products because Amazon will not take back food items.<br /><br />As far as the oil, the new Avocado oil tastes like real Avocados with no rancid taste or smell and the Hazelnut is out of this world.

I've also read that it's just as healthy. The smoke point of avocado oil is somewhere north of 500F! Roughly 520F in fact. That's amazing, and gives me the versatility I need to quick-fire or sear virtually anything under high heat. La Tourangelle's Avocado Oil, one of the few I've tried, tastes great! Fresh and subtly aromatic.<br /><br />Basically, this has been the cure to my burned olive oil blues.

To sum it up, though I don't always cook with it (I still use olive oil for low and medium temperature cooking), I love having avocado oil close at hand, for those times when I need it. It actually won't replace your olive oil though, because it has a somewhat different flavor, but it is a flavor I love. Avocado oil is ingenious (and a somewhat new discovery), and La Tourangelle is a trusted producer of the finest of fine edible oils. I trust their brand for some other less well-known oils as well.<br /><br />Highly and enthusiastically recommended--to the point that I'm trying to persuade my family and friends to start cooking with Avocado oil.\",\n",
       " 'Although olive oil is healthy for you, I guess I\\'ve never found one I really loved the flavor of--either NO flavor or tastes a bit like paint thinner--or the price was astronomical; whatever the case I\\'d become quite frustrated in my search.  Then I learned that when an oil smokes, it releases carcinogens into the air and free radicals within the oil.  Olive oil should NOT be heated beyond 325 degrees F.  So, in searching for an oil with a higher smoke point PLUS staying within a \"paleo\" eating way of life I discovered Avocado Oil.  This is my new holy grail of oils:  it\\'s got a smoke point of 510 degrees F, tastes wonderful, is made from a healthy fat, looks gorgeous in a homemade vinaigrette due to its beautiful green color.<br /><br />This oil should be refrigerated when opened; the cans have an expiration date of 8/2011--they\\'ll be long used up by then.  When my cans arrived, they had dented in a little bit--which I promptly got out by gently squeezing the cans (the metal is quite pliant).  I did advise Amazon that they need to wrap the cans in heavy bubble wrap to prevent this.  Somehow this oil is not yet well known--but it should and will be.  Hope Amazon keeps stocking it.<br /><br />I would DEFINITELY, HIGHLY recommend this product!!!!',\n",

Poop is still poop, but the smell is minimal.  I have noticed it also quickly disinigrates into the ground when it rains.  With the cheap food, it smelled like rank dog poop! Would make you retch and gag!  And there was so much of it!  Less poop, firmer stools with barely any odor, less food consumed per day.  AND NO BAD BREATH from your dog! A food that swells up when wet is also undesirable.  Flint River Ranch brand and Canidae both stay intact, avoiding the bloat factor. I learned, you can learn too!

He's been sensitive to different foods in the past, but never as violently as this.<br />It's disturbing that they would make this switch without notification.

And, best of all, no more itching or hot spots.

       " '**Update: March 2012**  I still feed this grain free kibble to my shelties, they still love it and I\\'m still very happy with it.  I\\'ve found a way to eliminate gas in my younger sheltie - mixing the dry kibble with a bit of hot water and letting it sit for 5 minutes before feeding the furry kids.  For some reason, my younger sheltie\\'s tummy finds this easier to digest and now he doesn\\'t have gas at all.  Woohoo!  So now I\\'m able to feed more of this kibble, they get twice as much of it than they used to.  I think I\\'ve been feeding this Canidae Grain Free to my dogs for almost 5 years now, and my dogs have never had an upset tummy.<br /><br />By the way, buying directly from Amazon for this item says \"Usually ships in 3 to 4 weeks\", but 1-2 days after I order I\\'ll get an update email from Amazon saying something like \"Good news - We\\'re able to ship this sooner than we thought!  Your item will be delivered a week from the date you ordered.\"  And sure enough, it arrives within a week of ordering.<br /><br />**Original review**<br />I feed my dogs the Canidae grain-free All Life Stages food (now called Canidae pureElements, I don\\'t think Amazon has updated the photo or name of this food yet but the ingredients haven\\'t changed) - why the Grain Free variety?  My younger sheltie has epilepsy.  Gluten and corn are possible seizure triggers, so I feed both my shelties a wheat, corn, & gluten free diet.  Canidae is only part of that diet;  I feed them 4 small meals a day - 1/4 cup Canidae Grain Free ALS, then a 4\" piece of raw turkey neck, then veggies for the last two meals.  The last meal is sometimes another 1/4 cup of Canidae instead of veggies.  I know, it\\'s complicated, right?  But my dogs really do better on a mostly raw diet like this.  I still use kibble because it\\'s the fastest way to feed them a meal first thing in the morning before I let them out to go potty.<br /><br />I\\'ve fed a variety of kibbles from the natural pet food shops, some with grain and others grain free, and when I fed them an all-kibble diet (Canidae or other brands) my younger sheltie had TERRIBLE gas, while my older sheltie had anal gland problems where she\\'d have an anal sac blowout at least once a month.  So gross, but that\\'s why we covered our couches in blankets that were easily washed.  (Gosh I hope you\\'re not eating lunch while you read this review.)  Anyway, I started giving them more raw food and the gas has disappeared and my girl sheltie no longer has anal gland issues.  Their teeth are cleaner too.<br /><br />I didn\\'t want this to turn into a \"raw food is the only way to go\" preaching session, I swear!  But for my dogs, raw is better - it\\'s easier for my younger sheltie to digest so he doesn\\'t gas us out of our home, and it gives my older sheltie firmer poo so her anal glands work like they\\'re supposed to.  Canidae doesn\\'t help my dogs\\' particular issues like raw does.<br /><br />However, Canidae is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper to feed, and my furry kids certainly do love Canidae\\'s taste, they inhale it.  If your dog doesn\\'t have weird kibble digestion issues like mine do, then Canidae Grain Free ALS is a 5 star dog food.  For my dogs\\' sensitive systems, it\\'s a 4-star food.<br /><br />The Canidae Grain-Free All Life Stages has a 34% protein level, which seems to do better with my shetland sheepdogs\\' stomachs than the higher protein kibbles.  I\\'ve fed another brand of grain-free kibble (Innova EVO turkey & chicken) that had 42% protein which was too high for them to handle even when switching to it gradually and only getting a 1/4 cup a day... 42% protein made their poo liquid.  So, I\\'ve stuck with Canidae\\'s grain free ALS.<br /><br />I\\'ve also done a 50/50 mix with the Grain Free ALS and the Grain Free Salmon, the furry kids love it.  The Salmon variety smells like FISH, big surprise, right?  I try not to breathe when dishing it out, don\\'t care for the smell of fish like the pups do.<br /><br />As I write this, Amazon\\'s price is the same as my local natural pet store.

Our dogs have done very well on it until recently (we always bought the 40 pound bags for our three LARGE dogs but now it's in the 35 pound bags) when they all became ill with diarrhea.  My oldest dog has had diarrhea and horrible hot spots all over his buttocks with the fur falling out and flaky dry skin for the last few weeks.  After one of my dogs was sick all over the house today, my husband mentioned that he was beginning to suspect it was the Canidae -- he suspected that Canidae may have changed their formula, so I checked the Internet to see if anyone else was complaining and there are complaints all over the Internet!  Apparently Canidae changed their formula without warning and many dogs who have tolerated it well in the past are suddenly becoming violently ill.  My husband is picking up a bag of another brand tonight, that we have used with no problems in the past, so that we don't have to feed them any more of the Canidae. Most dog owners know NOT to change their pets food suddenly as it can cause them to become ill, but apparently Canidae did it without warning anyone or allowing them the opportunity to gradually switch their dogs over to the new formula.  Apparently Canidae is blaming 'net hysteria as the reason why people are blaming their food for these dog illnesses -- but our dogs have been sick for several weeks now, way BEFORE we even suspected it was the Canidae.\",\n",

They did great on it until yesterday we bought a new bag and they became violently ill after only eating one bowl.

They did not even notify consumers!<br />My dogs have very sensitive stomachs. What they may consider a simple change made them very sick. This is a complete disregard for the dogs they supposedly care for. I understand they need to make money but notify the consumer so they can make an educated decision or buy the old formula at a higher price.',\n",

Samson LOVES this stuff too, with the Iams I had to entice him to eat by mixing it with canned food/tablefood, but with the Canidae, he eagerly wolfs it down by itself. And why not? The first 4 ingredients are all meats- human-grade at that! Besides having less \"filler\", Canidae uses no corn products, which is good for dogs with allergies (corn is a common allergen in dogs). Some may balk at the price, but you are going to use less food per day then with the junk brands due to the high quality of indredients in this stuff. Besides, Canidae is considerably cheaper then most of the other top-shelf brands like Eagle Pack or Flint River. I\\'m just happy to be able to feed my dog a \"super-premium\" grade food knowing how much healthier this is for him, for just a few bucks more per bag then a mid-grade food like Iams or Pro Plan.

No allergies either, unlike most of my friends whose poor dogs suffer from all kind of food or skin problems. I've convinced one person to change to Canidae and she too is very happy with how well her golden is doing on it. I buy it locally as I go thru 40 pounds every 3 weeks (feeding 3 large dogs). I highly recommend this food, could not be happier.<br /><br />Update: Canidae moved their manufacturing to a different plant in late 2008 and at the same time, in order to save money, changed their formulas. Added a lot more grain and other products that have caused dogs to have numerous skin and GI problems. The organization that oversees pet food standards has received more complaints about Canidae than any manufacturer in recent history, due to their formula change. A fried of mine owns a pet supply store and he says he is getting about 50% of the Canidae bags back from owners w/ pets having problems w/ the new formula. All 3 of my dogs had bad reactions, and I even did a gradual change over because I was told ahead of time (by my friend) that they changed the formula. Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, scratching. My one golden scratched himself raw to the point I had to take him to the vet. After using Canidae for many years, and recommending it to many others, I decided enough is enough and got rid of all of it. I switched to using California Natural Lamb and Rice and Orijen Adult, two all natural foods produced with the highest quality control available. Both company control the ingredients, manufacture the food, have numerous quality checkpoints, and do their own distribution. My dogs are different ages and have different needs so I do a blend of the CalNat and Orijen and  WOW, what a difference. Their coats are shiny, their energy levels are great and poops are solid and virtually odor free. And they love it! Both are great foods, a bit more expensive than other foods but to me, worth every penny. Cal Nat and Orijen are the best foods you can buy in my opinion. If you are considering Canidae, I'd recommend you look at Cal Nat or Orijen instead.<br /><br />New Rating:<br />Canidae - 0 stars<br />California Natural - 5 stars<br />Orijen - 5 stars (I'd give Orijen 10 stars if I could, it really is that good).\",\n",

The only dog who will eat this new bag is the one who has been on a diet for two years and quite frankly, will eat anything.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed that the change in the formula was not even mentioned on the bag and that they changed a great food into one that my dogs won't eat.<br /><br />NOTE: I emailed Canidae to ask why the formula had changed, and why it was not mentioned on the new bags.  Their response:<br /><br />*********<br />Our quality of raw material as well as quality control has actually increased not decreased.

Other dog owners/breeders/vets/handlers have also reported problems with Canidae foods over the past few months.  No one, including myself, has been successful in getting any sort of satisfactory reply from Canidae when asked if they had changed formulas, ingredient suppliers, etc. I'm disappointed-- Canidae was one of the few 'quality foods' that had not raised prices significantly over the past year and was still affordable for most dog owners.  Apparently that has also led to changes that the company has not been willing to address.  I'm very disappointed that a food I recommended so highly in the past has had these problems.

(And if you\\'re considering this food good enough for your own consumption, please note that the ingredient is also potentially toxic to human organs).<br /><br />Here\\'s the list of ingredients, from the manufacturer\\'s website:<br /><br />Fish broth<br />Tuna fillets<br />Yellow fin whole loin tuna/red snapper/shrimp/sole<br />Soy bean oil<br />Trialcium phosphate<br />Guar gum<br />Calcium sulfate<br />Carrageenan<br />Vitamins and Minerals<br />Vitamin E supplement<br />Vitamin A supplement<br />Vitamin D3 supplement<br />Zinc Sulfate<br />Thiamine Mononitrate<br />Manganese sulfate<br />Menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of vitamin K activity)<br />Riboflavin supplement<br />Folic acid<br />Pyridoxine hydrochloride<br />Copper amino acid complex<br />Iron amino acid complex<br /><br />First of all, it\\'s great that the manufacturer has whole seafood as the major ingredients (as opposed to the by-products, meal, grains, etc). But there is one item which I would not have expected to find in something of this quality: Menadione sodium bisuifite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for the K vitamins and has been reported, at high doses, to have toxic effects. Moreover, I had actually never seen menadione listed as an ingredient in other cat foods (though there seem to be others out there).<br /><br />A little bit of Internet sleuthing yielded some disturbing information, which I feel obliged to list here.<br /><br />*Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It\\'s also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />*There are safer alternatives to menadione for proper K vitamin-related functions (e.g. blood clotting). The use of menadione over the alternatives (leafy greens, kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food.<br /><br />*A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione \"produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung.\" Chiou et al.

I don\\'t know for sure, but I wish that I\\'d been more aware about this ingredient before feeding it to my cats. Admittedly, more research needs to be done regarding this subject. In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I\\'m erring on the side of caution on this one.',\n",
       " 'I\\'m a serious label-reader, even more so for my cat than for myself, so before I ordered Petite Cuisine, I went to their website to see what they had to say for themselves.  I was pleased to read that they use no wheat gluten in their food, nor meat by-products; neither belongs in pet food.  They also make a point of saying that they use no products from China.  It\\'s a reassurance I appreciate in the light of the recent spate of pet deaths linked to product coming out of China.<br /><br />What they do use was also reassuring.  White meat chicken, veggies, olive or soybean oils, vitamins and minerals.  The sesame chicken does contain rice which isn\\'t something that should necessarily  be fed often, but it\\'s a minor consideration.  While it\\'s never said that the ingredients are \"human grade\" they are listed as safe for humans to eat.  I don\\'t know about anyone else but I wouldn\\'t want to feed my pets anything that wasn\\'t safe for me to eat.<br /><br />The carton arrived and was marked as \"Product of Thailand\" which was a bit of a surprise since no mention of Thailand appears on their site.  They are, however, quick to point out that no child labor is used in production of any of the food.  (It\\'s also listed as \"dolphin safe.\"  This is a pretty politically correct company.)<br /><br />Of course the proof of the pudding, or in this case, the cat food, is the eating.  My response as I opened the cans was the the sesame chicken looked and smelled very tempting.  The chicken pot pie, not so much.  It smells wonderful, but is very watery.  Again, this is a minor consideration.  If my cat likes it, that\\'s the important thing.  He\\'s a picky boy, in part because he can\\'t eat beef or lamb, so he\\'s limited to poultry and certain types of fish.  He doesn\\'t tend to like the souped-up, holistic foods that add things like rosemary and acai and all those things which humans so cheerfully add to their own foods.  But this stuff is pretty basic, and, well let\\'s just say, he doesn\\'t hate it.  I can probably add it to the rotation without causing much consternation, and know that he\\'s getting a quality meal.<br /><br />Your mileage -- or your cat\\'s -- may vary, of course.  Cats are perverse little beasts, and you just never know what they\\'re going to take violent dislike to.  I can\\'t tell you if your cat will like this food or not, but I can tell you that it looks like quality product made by people who have high standards.  Yes, it\\'s pricey, but if you feel, as I do, that your cat deserves the consideration you\\'d give to any member of the family, you probably won\\'t balk at the cost.<br /><br />The rest is up to your cat.',\n",

Due to this, it has 4 grams of sugar per 1 Tbsp serving, double the sugar of another bottle of regular ketchup I have.  Since most of us use at least 2 Tbsp per serving this is quite a bit of sugar.<br /><br />Second, this uses Potassium Chloride, the main ingredient of No Salt salt substitute.

I wish I had had the Internet back then so I could have saved her life.  She eventually ended up getting stomach cancer and dying at the very young age of five.  I truly believe that if we had switched her to a quality food, she could have lived a longer, happier life. It was an important lesson for me to learn, and I will never feed any of my animals sub-par food ever again.<br /><br />I have had my current dog on Natural Balance Ultra Premium as well as Solid Gold Hund n Flocken.  Both of those foods are of good quality, but are also very pricey.  If you would like to do your own research on different food options and brands, [...]and [...]are great sites.<br /><br />Natural Balance, Solid Gold, and Premium Edge have all received 4-star ratings at dog food analysis.  The biggest issue with Premium Edge (and all of Diamond foods--including NB and SG) was the fact that there weren't any written guarantees that they did not use Ethoxyuin as a preservative.  I emailed Diamond foods, and received an email stating that they and their suppliers no longer use Ethoxyquin as a preservative.<br /><br />I'm really impressed with Premium Edge.  It is a good quality food and it comes at a much better price for me (on top of being significantly cheaper, the bags are 35lbs as opposed to NB and SG's 33lb. bags).  The final selling point for me is that my dog really LOVES her food now.  With both previous brands, she would eat half of her food and then walk away and eat the rest of it later when she got hungry enough.  With Premium Edge Skin and Coat, she scarfs everything down right away.  She even BEGS me to feed her in the morning and evening now.<br /><br />All in all, I'm really happy with my choice to switch to Premium Edge.  It's an affordable, good quality dog food, and my dog LOVES it!  I highly recommend giving it a try.  :)\",\n",

I am surprised because I prefer brown rice and wild rice to white rice and generally enjoy whole wheat products.  But to this eater, the whole wheat shells were too heavy and chewy.

Tastes much better when cooked 10-11 minutes at sea-level (the box recommends 8-10), the texture is less rough and gummy and is more noodle-y.<br /><br />2.  Adding fresh herbs with the cheese sauce.  It gives a depth to the flavor.  My favorite herb to add (so far) is cilantro (add about 1/3 cup chopped after mixing in the cheese sauce).

I have long been a fan of animal fats when used in moderation (O-K, not always in moderation, I did makes some duck-fat french fries not too long ago, INCREDIBLE!).  Yes, many people eat way too much fat, but more importantly they often eat the wrong ones.  Certain hydrogenated fats not only have dubious effects on our health they just don't add as much flavor as traditional fats such as butter, olive oil, chicken fat and, yes duck fat.<br /><br />I try to watch both my calorie and fat intake but I do so by eating less and choosing my fats for flavor.  Duck fat gives ordinary dishes like spinach or mashed potatoes more taste and complexity that would butter or, God forbid, margarine.  The French have known this for centuries and use duck fat to add flavor and depth to a wide variety of foods.<br /><br />I sometimes buy my duck fat in larger tubs, 10-16 oz., but I like these little 1.5 oz. containers.  They stay fresh on the shelf when unopened and then I use the entire thing, not needing to worry about finding room for it in my overly-stocked refrigerator.  The cost per ounce is not to bad when buying it in these little cups, about the same as some of the larger tubs. The only thing that I don't like is the the oils and fat solids tend to separate.  Not a big deal if I am mixing it into a dish or browning something with it, but if I want to use it as a spread (highly recommended) I have to stick it in the fridge first and then stir it up.  Other than that I must say that this is a staple for me and a great addition to any pantry (when used reasonably, of course).\",\n",

       " 'I was told years ago by many of the chefs at whose restaurants I dined in France and Italy that the quality of the spices in Europe is much higher because of the demand for the higher quality; as a result, we apparently do not receive the grade A spices in the US.  I was impressed by the quality of the spices at Hediard, Fauchon, etc...until recently.<br /><br />Many of those same chefs use either a large amount of, or exclusively, white pepper in their cooking, which was very surprising, as I had tried many sources, usually finding a fetid/fecal aroma in the background (sometimes the foreground!) of much of the product that I had purchased.  I commented on this to the previous head of Spice Hunter, who said that the problem is in production.  The least expensive method is the soak the peppercorns in ponds to remove the outer covering; the ponds become stagnant and the stagnant (read: fetid) aroma becomes part of the peppercorns.  The more expensive method is to soak the peppercorns in running water, which overcomes that problem.<br /><br />There is no comment about the production of this product, but I would be amazed if it were not the latter.  The aroma is so very exciting, with floral and spicy tones, and not a hint in the least of the off-putting aromas of other sources, even such well-known sources as Penzeys.

       " \"One of my biggest frustrations with doing Weight Watchers was always the problem of finding good chips.  I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.  I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next.\",\n",

I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip.  The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor.  The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they\\'re almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their \"original\" flavor...I can\\'t imagine what the \"Salt & Pepper\" style must be like.<br /><br />I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.

It almost tastes like Swiss Miss cocoa (and while Swiss Miss is not really my idea of great cocoa, for a protein drink mixed with water, that is pretty good!)<br /><br />Summary: This is the best non-whey, non-soy protein I have found, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with soy+whey/dairy sensitivities! I rated this 4 stars, but if you can't have whey, it is definitely a 5-star product.<br /><br />I'm allergic to both whey and soy, which has made finding a good protein supplement quite a pain! I have tried pretty much everything on the market, including a variety of wheat, buckwheat, and brown rice proteins.  If you are looking for the highest quality protein available, you are unfortunately limited to egg, soy, whey, or casein (based upon PDCAAS, the FDA and FAO/WHO's method of determining protein quality), so egg is really preferable to the alternatives.  Fortunately, this is, in terms of consistency, digestibility, and nutritive content (0 fat 0 carbs), and overall flavor, the best of the various proteins I tried.  In case you are wondering, there is no cholesterol in this protein, either.  Texture and overall 'drinkability' are great... I drink it mixed with water with no issues.  Flavor is decent: obviously, none of us are drinking protein powder expecting a gourmet flavor extravaganza.  This protein is decently tasty if you like chocolate (not as good as most whey/casein proteins, but better than almost all non-whey proteins... I tried quite a few of those as well before discovering that I could not tolerate dairy proteins).  Be warned: the vanilla version of this product tastes terrible.  In my opinion, it is barely drinkable.<br /><br />Four stars overall.  If I had no food sensitivities, I might still use this in conjunction with whey protein, but would probably not use it exclusively.<br />Five stars if you can't have whey protein!<br /><br />I hope that this review is helpful!\",\n",

       " \"This stuff is so worth it, and when you do the math, it's actually a bargain.  More on that later....<br /><br />Some background:  My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier.  He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband).  He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food.  Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison.  Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Amazon.  I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...).  So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats.  Titan went mad for them.  It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares.  You see, it's raw air dried venison, and it comes in these little compact squares about the size of a dime of venison jerky.  But it's still soft, almost velvety, as it is still raw.<br /><br />Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door.  He barely lifted his head from the bowl.  For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France.  When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure.  Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine.<br /><br />Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept.  When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet.  I added a little canned venison to entice him.  No go.  Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating.  Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there.  Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag.  Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag.  I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time.  The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO!<br /><br />But back to my point:  I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!).  So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain.  And, it is high quality.  Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam?  Titan's never had that with this stuff.  I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up.<br /><br />So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line.  I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!).  I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well.\",\n",

The company sent me a Venison trial bag and I purchased the Lamb 2.2lb bag and she lovesssss it. She wakes me up now at 8am whimpering by the bag because she wants it soooo much.

It is absent the corn and wheat products that you should avoid.  It is not a totally dry food but comes in a bag and is more dry than wet.  I suggest you also store in the refrigerator.  The four rating is because it is also one of the most expensive products - so much so that I may have to keep searching for a less expensive alternative.  I am also concerned at recent reports that the concentration of too much animal protein in a dog's diet may create organ problems.  If you use this food check for portion size which is less than your usual kibble.  And don't forget to give your four legged friend a sprout of brocolli, chip of sweet potatoe and some other vegetables now and then.

Nowhere on the amazon product page does it tell you where these treats are made, so I searched for the Smokehouse website which claimed that ONLY some of their CHICKEN treats contained chicken from China, but all other products are made in the USA. So, I felt safe in purchasing these duck/sweet potato treats. After opening a bag, and giving them to my dog did I glance at the product origin. Needless to say my dog likes them very much, but I was NOT happy to find PRODUCT OF CHINA on the bag.<br /><br />Boo hiss to amazon for not putting the product origin on the product page, and to Smokehouse for misleading consumers on their product information website. Why do they do this, because there are customers just like me that care where the product originates. Many of you may not be concerned about this, but I am, and I think it's very misleading not to provide accurate, and complete information about the product when purchasing from an internet store. At least the product doesn't smell like plastic like the Dingo products.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing these again. My dog seemed to like them, but she won't be getting anymore of them. I took a star off due to the lack of complete information from amazon, and misleading information from Smokehouse.<br /><br />UPDATE: Big thumbs up to amazon for great customer service. When I called to return this item they were very helpful in processing a refund, and because it is considered a grocery item I didn't even have to return the items. I had also purchased the Smokehouse duck chips, but they too are made in China. I suggested the addition of the country of origin to both product pages.

       " 'I recently got this Kyjen Kibble Drop puzzle toy for our two dogs. We have a 65 lb German Shepherd Dog and a 60 lb Golden Retriever. Both have been learning \"nosework\" so I thought this would be a fun toy to add to our scenting games.  I plan to use it by dropping one yummy treat at a time and having them find and get it from one of the 4 cups.<br /><br />I\\'ll give you my conclusion first, and then you can decide if you want to read the details below for more info (including size of the toy info).<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />I don\\'t see how this toy could just be put on the ground and left for your dog to get the food out of the cups. Unless you have a very small dog, your dog\\'s attempts will just move the toy around on the floor.  For larger dogs (like ours) the toy is way too lightweight and the flaps over the cups are too low to the ground for effective \"nosing the flap\" technique. In addition, any dog who couldn\\'t nose the flap effectively would need to use her mouth -- and would naturally pick the arm up in her mouth in an attempt to get at the treats in the cup - thereby dumping all of the treats out of the other cups (hey - problem solved!!!). So, that means to play with this, you\\'d have to be there to hold the toy down/in-place while your dog does the puzzle and gets the treats.<br /><br />I think this toy would work best (maybe) for a small dog. Kyjen needs to make a heavier and larger sized version for medium or larger dogs.<br /><br />---------<br />.... Now, the details ....<br /><br />First, let me give you some sizing basics about this toy, so you can see if it will be a match for your dog\\'s size.  I measured the toy and it\\'s 10\" wide.  The top of the drop-in treat hole chamber is 4\" high. Each arm sticks out almost 4\" from the middle dispenser. Each treat cup at the end of the arm is about 2\"x2\" when you lift the flap.  If you look at the very end of the arm, where the flap shuts, the height of the flap edge from the ground is under 1\".  The arms of the toy obviously slope upwards from the end, so I am talking about the very end of the arm. This is an extremely lightweight plastic toy, weighing in at just 6.2 oz.<br /><br />Whew, now that all the stats are out of the way... how is the actual puzzle toy?<br /><br />Initially, I had all the flaps open and just put a treat in an open cup so they could \"find\" it. They didn\\'t have to open the flaps during that phase. The 2x2\" cup size is just adequate enough for them to get the treat out. If your dog is good at licking a treat out, this small size will work fine. If your dogs likes to mouth the treat out, and you have a larger dog, the 2x2 chamber size will likely be an issue. Our GSD was having trouble getting treats out because of this, although she eventually figured out how to cram her nose in there and use her tongue at the same time. :)  I would imagine a really large dog would have to be pretty good with his tongue to get a treat out of the small cups.<br /><br />An issue that appeared right away even with this simple usage was that the toy is SO lightweight it moves as soon as the dog touches it. I had to hold the toy in place or else they would just push it across the floor while trying to lick the treat out of the (flap open) cup.  I think Kyjen needs to add some weight to help keep this toy from moving so easily. The bottom has little rubber non-skid feet on each arm, but they do nothing.<br /><br />So... moving on to the phase where they had to open the flap to get the treat.... There is an issue here. For larger dogs, the flap is so low to the ground, that they can have trouble nosing it up. Our Golden tends to lie in front of what she \"finds\" when scenting. So, her head was already down on the ground level, which made it easier to work on flipping open the very-low-to-the-ground flap. Our GSD stays standing, though. So, from that angle, she couldn\\'t really use her nose to flip the flap up (although she tried). She also used her mouth to try and open it, pawed at it, etc. I\\'m sure if I wasn\\'t there to hold the toy from sliding, she would have just picked the whole thing up in her mouth -- problem solved! :)<br /><br />Now you can see why I wrote my summary above. From my experience, this is just the wrong size/weight toy for our dogs. I\\'ll still use it for scent games, because I only need to drop one piece at a time in and I can hold the toy in place for this. But I am not sure how else this toy could be used unless you have a small dog.<br /><br />This is a hard toy to rate because of these issues. It\\'s a good idea, but the implementation is flawed. Which is why I rated it so low.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />c-',\n",

       " \"I became familiar with this powder, as well as many other dry products from Barry Farms, when my son was little and we were involved in scouting together.  Even years after he left the scouts I remained involved at the large regional camp here for the boy scouts teaching survival training. And I still do a lot of hiking and camping on my own. Powdered spices, veggies, cheeses, bullion, and various stocks were a staple item on camping trips due to their convenience.  Some of the dry wares were much better than others.  This tomato powder was definitely one that turned out to be consistently convenient and tasty, and thus worthy of recommending.  We used it when we made stews and soups and it added a flavorful tomato taste to the various broths and stocks.  I would not recommend this product for making tomato soup since its rather costly, and besides, dried soups are easy and cheap for taking along on a hike.  It is best used in enriching the flavor of a soup or stew, whether it be a ready made mix, or one you are making from stock.  It is very rich and surprisingly good.  I took one star off for it is a little costly for only the 2 oz. you get.  But for what its designed for, it is worth the price since you don't use all that much at once.  As I have stated in my other reviews of dried foods like Barry Farm brands, there will always be a core group of consumers that would never give a favorable nod to a powdered food substitute of any kind.  This powder is definitely not going to remind you of the old home days of native tomato's from Grammas back yard for sure.  If you feel you are one of those that never considered a dry substitute of any kind real food, trust me that this is no time to start feeling like Daniel Boone by trying out this powder.  However if you are one that does a lot of hiking and camping where cooking your own meals over an open fire is a big part of that experience, by all means this tasty powder would greatly enliven that experience.

       " '<span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 1:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>(* this review was originally posted for the 3 oz size, a verified purchase by me on Amazon)<br /><br />I purchased three well reviewed brands of catnip for Tristan, my six month old Savannah cat. In the video, I have just placed down three plates of catnip from freshly opened packages. The brands from left to right are <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028HN5A\">Sojos Certified Organic Catnip</a>, in the middle is the product in this listing - Cosmic Catnip (this video review shows the 3oz jar), and on the far right we have <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNEII0\">Frontier Catnip Leaf & Flower C/s Certified Organic, 16 Ounce Bag</a>.<br /><br />Like the little bear at Goldilock\\'s table, Tristan tries a bit from each plate; at the end of this clip he seemed to have no *overwhelming* preference for any particular brand though. As far as his physical reactions to each (sampled separately), he did not act \"stoned\" nor hyper, he merely scratches on his scratch pad a bit more with catnip than without catnip and gives himself a good stretch. He also strongly prefers catnip infused mice to non-catnip mice and I\\'m happy to oblige.<br /><br />As as far which *I* prefer, if it\\'s all the same to the cat (and it seems that it is) here\\'s my take on things -<br /><br />The Frontier brand is by far the least expensive at just under fifteen dollars for 16oz. It is slightly more coarse and seems to have a little bit of stems mixed in. VERY fragrant though and turned out to be a close second favorite of the cat reviewing the products. I would definitely buy the Frontier brand again and use it for stuffing toys generously or for \"marinating\" his little cloth mice. Organic and suitable even for human consumption if you like it as a tea.<br /><br />The Sojos brand (1oz can) is the most expensive - by my calculations comes to over a hundred dollars for 16oz!. The description says it produces a \"harmless, euphoric state\" but we saw no evidence of that. Smelled fresh but definitely a milder aroma than the other two brands; had the finest chopped leaves of the three. Hand harvested if that is important you or your cat.<br /><br />With the Cosmic Cat brand, we *may* have a winner.....<br /><br />When the camera was off, Tristan returned to the Cosmic Cat sample several times more so than the other brands. I repeated this little taste test for the next two days and Cosmic Cat had a small but definite edge over the competition. I\\'d have to say that I agree with his choice; the Cosmic Cat brand leaves are darker and more fragrant than the other two brands. The leaves are also cut just right - not too fine/not too large, and no stems or coarse pieces. I find the Cosmic Cat brand\\'s price reasonable, the storage container is very convenient, and the 3oz* size is enough not to be too little and not so much to get stale and spoil.<br /><br />Hope you find this information useful in choosing for your own cat or kitten.',\n",

Both sugars were caramel in color with the blonde being a little lighter.  The smell and taste was very similar to brown sugar, however the texture was dryer.  The granules were not a consistent size as with cane sugar.  No \"coconut\" taste whatsoever.<br /><br />I wanted to bake with this sugar to see if it was interchangeable with cane sugar.  Coconut sugar is supposed to be less calories and have a lower glycemic level compared to cane sugar.  As I understand glycemic levels, the lower the level, the easier it is for your body to metabolize, thus not creating that \"sugar crash\".<br /><br />To compare to cane sugar, I used a 1:1 ratio as suggested by the company.  I ate it raw on cinnamon toast (blonde), and made pancakes (blonde) and Toll House cookies with it (both blonde and regular).  For the most part I found it to be completely interchangeable with cane sugar in recipes.

(2) This enables one to make powdered sugar (just add 1 TB arrowroot powder or tapioca starch per 1 cup finely blended coconut sugar).  Then coconut sugar can be used to make icing and the like.  (3) Sweetened condensed milk can also be made. (See allrecipes.com's recipe for regular sweetened condensed milk.  Ingredients are: 1 1/8 powdered milk, 1/2 cup water, 3/4 cup coconut sugar, blended to a fine consistency.)  It isn't all that pretty (beige color) but it makes wonderful lemon bars.<br /><br />Coconut sugar doesn't taste exactly like cane sugar (more maple-y and hearty), but there is no sugar crash since it has a low glycemic index of 35 (lower than apples and carrots).  It is loaded with potassium, along with nitrogen, zinc, magnesium and several vitamin Bs (as opposed to agave syrup, which is fairly empty of any nutritional value).<br /><br />Additionally, this price that Amazon offers is less than my co-op's bulk price.\",\n",

       " 'This food is fantastic. I used it for a year then switched to a holistic, premium brand dry kibble (Wysong), and am now considering going back to Dr. Harvey\\'s. This is why:<br /><br />1--On Dr. Harvey\\'s, there was less poop, it was practically odorless, and healthy and firm (the higher quality food you give your dog, the less it stinks and the less comes out. I\\'ve noticed a huge difference now that we\\'re on kibble.)<br /><br />2--It gives your dog a variety of food. Every time you make a new batch, you rotate the protein source--chicken, beef, scrambled eggs, turkey, fish, and even chickpeas and lentils (both of which our dogs LOVED!) and a different oil source (flax oil, fish oil, olive oil, sesame oil). I know people have done it for years, but it just can\\'t be completely healthy to feed your pet the same exact thing day after day, year after year. There\\'s just something very counter-intuitive about that...<br /><br />3--My dogs\\' breath was better on Dr. Harvey\\'s--no joke! I brush my dogs\\' teeth every night and I can tell that it\\'s gotten worse since we stopped feeding them Dr. Harvey\\'s (and nothing\\'s changed in the brushing).<br /><br />Now, I should let you know why we switched from Dr. Harvey\\'s in the first place:<br /><br />1--It is a little on the expensive side. You can rotate with cheaper protein sources (lentils or chickpeas for $1/lb or eggs) to make it more affordable some weeks, but dogs need MEAT, and the only kind worth buying--that doesn\\'t come from horrific living conditions and is not pumped with hormones--is expensive (though for good reason--watch \"Food, Inc.\"). I found boiling whole chickens made it more affordable ($4/lb) than deboned chicken breasts ($8/lb), but they still need that beef, and that we couldn\\'t get that too often for them. (Ethical turkey is expensive, too.)<br /><br />2--It\\'s a bit high maintenance (my husband would say \\'very\\'). There were several times we ran out and I had to go to the store, come back and cook up a batch for my hungry dogs (1 hour after \\'asking\\' for it...). Now that we\\'re on kibble it\\'s so simple and convenient, and our dogs go hungry less often.  (Note: if you are more organized than me--which is likely--you probably wont run into this problem :) Also--you could also do this differently--we weighed out each and every portion we gave our dogs (one got 7.5oz, one got 4.5oz per meal), and that also added some time. Also, it takes 10 minutes to defrost it if it\\'s frozen and you didn\\'t defrost ahead of time. Dr. Harvey\\'s also added more dishes (for the cooking, the measuring), which is tough living in a small, NYC dishwasher-less apartment.<br /><br />Those two last points aside, I kind of miss our Dr. Harvey\\'s days. It always deeply warmed my heart to feed my dogs \\'real\\' food that was so colorful (peas, carrots, spinach, beets!) and that smelled sooo good! We\\'ll see--if their \\'conditions\\' don\\'t improve (bad breath, softish stool, itchiness), we might go back to Dr. Harvey\\'s (and if we can find a place to get affordable, ethical meats.)<br /><br />And just because this Amazon ad does a horrible job of telling you about the product, here are some important details:<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic Brown Rice, Organic Kamut, Organic Oats, Organic Spelt, Organic Barley, Organic Triticale, Potatoes*, Carrots*, Zucchini*, Sweet Potatoes**, Peas**, Broccoli, Green Beans, Beets, Calcium Citrate, Parsley, Lecithin, Garlic, Bee Pollen, Nutritional Yeast, Alfalfa, Rose Hips, Red Clover, Oat Straw, Flax Seed Meal*, Papaya, Rosemary, Dandelion, Peppermint, Ginger, Spirulina*, Fenugreek*, Basil Leaf, Fennel Seed. (*Dehydrated; **Freeze-Dried) (incredible, right?!?!)<br /><br />And how we made it:<br />1--Pick a protein and cook it up (our dogs didn\\'t take to raw beef or chicken very well, but you can also do raw). Weigh the cooked protein--this determines the proportions of everything else you add (water, Dr. Harvey\\'s Mix, and oil). Process protein if need be (boiled chicken or turkey breasts, hard-boiled eggs.)<br />2--Boil up needed amount of water in a big pot. When boiled, add needed amount of Dr. Harvey\\'s dehydrated mix to the boiled water. Cover and let it sit and rehydrate for 8 minutes.<br />3--After 8 minutes, add the cooked protein to the big pot of rehydrated Dr. Harvey\\'s mix. Add needed amount of oil. Mix it all up, and it\\'s done! (The dogs go NUTS over the first, warm batch of Dr. Harvey\\'s! I don\\'t blame them--it smells sooo good!)<br /><br />We would make big batches and put 3-days\\' worth in the fridge (maximum amount of time) and freeze the rest.<br /><br />Note: it took us a while to figure out what proportions we needed for what. The instructions on the sheet inside give you guidance, but I ended up making my own chart because their\\'s wasn\\'t very helpful.  Also--we needed a scale (you might, too) to measure out how much protein you have--which will determine how much Mix, water and oil to use. It\\'s a little tricky, but definitely manageable.<br /><br />Dr. Harvey\\'s is fantastic, and he has a grain-free version, too (Veg-to-Bowl), which I have yet to try. I forgot to mention--I even spoke to Dr. Harvey myself when I had questions! How\\'s that for customer service?!<br /><br />In sum, Dr. Harvey\\'s is great if you\\'re a very conscientious pet parent and know what\\'s good for your pets (like me) but not so great if you\\'re a struggling grad student short of time and cash (like me). Good luck!',\n",
       " 'These smaller sized Sprout Master sprouters are great for smaller batches of leafy sprouts or bean sprouts. The optional tray dividers makes it easy to make small batches of as many as six different sprouts at a time. The larger tray would be better for big batches, but using these trays in concert can achieve the same effect. For most people (not feeding too large a family), I would suggest starting out with these and evaluating whether you often want to make larger batches than you can manage in a single smaller tray.<br /><br />There are four \"lids\" that come with this set and are all exactly the same. Put one below to catch any water and use the one on top if you want to block off light (this helps prevent the growth of green leaves, which is usually how bean sprouts are grown).  With four lids and three trays you\\'ll find it necessary to stack the trays if you want to cover more than one at a time. The Sprout Master\\'s drainage holes allow excess water to drain off very effectively.<br /><br />If you\\'ve sprouted in a jar before, you\\'ll probably find this to be much easier. Hold the tray under running cool water two or three times a day, then allow excess water to run off before putting the tray away. The sprouts should be thoroughly rinsed to prevent spoilage, kept moist at all times, but not allowed to sit in water. (By comparison, with jar sprouting you\\'d need to fill and drain the jar of sprouts repeatedly to rinse the sprouts well, then it\\'s more difficult to get them properly drained.)<br /><br />One minor complaint is that some of the smallest seeds can get caught in the drain holes. In my experience, broccoli is large enough to be safe, but with alfalfa or clover you might get a few seeds stuck. When you\\'re cleaning the tray after use you may need to get a small poking instrument to knock one or two out again. The \"Easy Sprouter\" device doesn\\'t have this problem, but allows slightly less light to reach your sprouts because of it\\'s shape.

I used one packet of this, one packet of the regular as well as one packet of another brand that I bought on Amazon (some little green packets) and made up a new batch of yogurt.  I used a little over two quarts of fresh farm milk, added a packet of each of the above mentioned starters, along with a little powdered milk to make a little thicker product (this is optional) and the resulting yogurt was so delicious and a good consistency! I take out a sample and put it in the freezer and use it for the next batch.  This way I don't use up my packets of starter very fast.  They keep indefinitely in the freezer.  The only time I use a new packet from the box is if for some reason my starter that I take out of each new batch starts to develop an off flavor from some stray bacteria that got in.  This rarely happens as long as I keep my sample in the freezer.  What a delicious, healthy food.  It's so good for you.\",\n",
       " \"This starter makes delicious yogurt. I like to use it with whole milk. You must first heat the milk up to at least 180 degrees and then cool it to 73-77 degrees. As the previous reviewer stated, you must use an icewater bath to cool the milk down. This works wonderfully. I let my yogurt incubate 15 hours and it is extremely thick and delicious! It has a bit of a tart taste, which is very yummy. I alternate using this yogurt with the Yogourmet freeze-dried yogurt for variety. I eat yogurt every single day and have been using Yogourmet starters for a couple of years now. I won't use any other brand as I've tried several and the ones from Yogourmet are the best.\",\n",
       " \"Bought this along with the Yogourmet yogurt maker.  (In retrospect, I probably didn't need to buy it separately because there was a package deal that included it).  The starter makes amazing yogurt, but it seems like it takes a long time to get going when starting with the starter, rather than saving yogurt and using that as a starter.  So, I'd recommend using this to start the culture, but then using yogurt from then on.  The probiotic blend does take longer and you have to start at a lower temperature, but the flavor is great and the health benefits are even better.  Oh, yeah, it's important to note that for 2 quarts of yogurt, you have to use 2 packets--something that isn't really mentioned, but each packet is only 5 grams.\",\n",
       " 'I love this product and have been using it for many years now. It makes a perfect yogurt every time. I use the Yogourmet incubator too - a gift from my mother when I got married 12 years ago. The gift that keeps on giving is always the best! I have tried all of the Yogourmet freeze dried starters with fantastic success. The Yogourmet Casei Bifidus Acidophilus Probiotic Yogurt Starter, is my favorite, found here on Amazon for a GREAT price. I give this company a 100% positive review. I have never had problems with any of their culture products or with the Yogourmet incubator machine.<br /><br />I use 2 quarts of milk with the recommended 10 grams of Yogourmet starter. I have found for myself, that the key to making great yogurt is to heat the milk to 185 degrees and continue cooking it at this temperature for 10 minutes. Cooking at this temperature kills any harmful bacteria in the milk that remains even after pasteurization. It also breaks down the proteins in the milk insuring a great yogurt SET. Apparently, the proteins are easier for your body to digest in this broken down state as well. Cool the 2 quarts of milk to 112 degrees, add starter, (10 grams freeze dried starter or 1/2 cup leftover yogurt from original batch) 1 1/2 cups optional powdered milk, up to 1 cup optional sugar and up to 1 tablespoon optional flavoring extracts. Incubate until desired tartness is reached. My kids prefer the maximum sugar so the yogurt tastes more like store bought. Although with this much sugar, the milk takes longer to turn into yogurt - up to 24 hours. Try using honey extract, vanilla extract, raspberry extract, etc.',\n",

Here\\'s why.<br /><br />\"COLAVITA - EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL\" has an impressive list of credentials that clearly set it apart from other makers of Olive Oil. This particular product boasts the following:<br /><br />-----*- Certification from the \"I.S.O.\" - \"International Standardization Organization\"<br /><br />-----*- \"Certified Authentic Product of Italy\", where the best olives for olive oil are grown under the best conditions<br /><br />-----*- Natural product, just olive oil - nothing added<br /><br />-----*- Excellent full-bodied taste<br /><br />What are the nutritional components?<br /><br />A tablespoon of olive oil contains 120 calories, 14 grams of fat, and no cholesterol. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of the fat in olive oil is monounsaturated and nine percent (9%) is polyunsaturated fat; fourteen percent (14%) is vegetable-derived saturated fat. Virgin olive oils also contain the antioxidants beta-carotene and Vitamin E, as well as the phenolic compounds tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol.<br /><br />WHAT EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE IS USED FOR:<br /><br />That being said, this is not an oil for cooking, as it has a very low smoke point. It is excellent for salads and for marinating and boasts a pretty low acid level. For cooking try their \"Extra Light\" product as it has a much higher smoke point.<br /><br />HEALTH BENEFITS:<br /><br />PROVEN PROTECTION AGAINST ATHEROSCLEROSIS:<br /><br />Eating foods high in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) [found in Olive, canola & flaxseed oil] will increase the blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids. ALA has been shown to confer a large measure of protection against atherosclerosis. As part of the \"Mediterranean\" diet, researchers used products high in ALA, and found that the ALA reduced the risk of dying from heart disease by 70% over the first 27 months.<br /><br />Canola and Peanut oil also contain large amounts of ALA and are similarly cardio-protective. The presence of a larger proportion of \"mono-saturated fats\" is central to the cardio-protective properties of the oil.<br /><br />-----*- NO Cholesterol -- -*- No Trans-Fat<br /><br />WHICH SIZE IS BEST FOR YOU?<br /><br />This and most of their conventional oils are available at most groceries and this exact product sells for about $7.00 for 17 ounces [.5 liter]. Bear in mind, that Olive Oil will become rancid if you store it for prolonged periods. You can, however, extend this period by keeping the oil in a cool and dry place, preferably dark. Also, don\\'t buy the largest containers unless you can finish them within 1-2 months. Stored correctly, Olive Oil will stay fresh for up to 2 years. Smaller containers like this 17-ounce bottle may be more costly per volume than the gallon, but the oil will be fresh when you use it and that is ultimately what its all about.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY.]',\n",

Many times, its my favorite part of the movie.<br /><br />So, I finally bought a movie style popcorn popper because I didnt like the taste of microwave popcorn.<br /><br />When I first got my popcorn popper, I just went to the grocery store, picked up a bag of popcorn, some of that powered popcorn butter flavoring and some vegetable oil. It did the job but, like microwave popcorn, just didnt replicate the taste of movie theater popcorn.<br /><br />I searched and read tons of reviews on Amazon and finally decided to order this brand.<br /><br />MY GOD!

I popped 2 of packets the first time and it was the equivalent of one of those huge buckets you\\'d get at the theater. I had to share. haha.<br /><br />Second: When I received the box of packets, I thought the oil was going to be a liquid. Its actually a solid. I had first thought I received a old batch but no, thats how its supposed to be.<br /><br />Third: Like the packets tell you... let your popper heat for about 5 minutes, then slide the \"solid\" oil contents into the popper as well as the corn/salt mix.

This popcorn is great-tasting with an ever-so-slight hint of coconut ... yes that is the extra something you taste in movie-theater corn! It's better than the popcorn from Wabash Valley Farms (the brand that comes with the Whirley Popper), in my opinion.  It tastes just like the kind you get at the movie theater or a carnival and the smell is just fantastic.  When using my WhirleyPop I usually only get about 10-12 unpopped kernels.  The more comfortable I get using the popper I'm sure that number will decrease.  The corn pops up nice and crispy without any greasiness (as sometimes movie theater popcorn can be).<br /><br />However, I do think that the popcorn is a bit too salty (thus giving it 4 stars instead of 5) for my family's taste so I use only 1/2 - 3/4 of the seasoning versus using the entire packet.<br /><br />I think I got a great deal being that I recieved the popcorn, oil, and seasoning all for $39.99 and free shipping.  It couldn't be easier because all I do is dump it all in the popper and 'turn the crank!<br /><br />A minor complaint I do have, and I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else, is that a few of the packets do leak a little bit; nothing major but enough to notice.

I have tried other brands as well, buying bulk popcorn kernels with Orvil Reddenbocker's popcorn oil and they do not even compare.

It tastes close to green apple, green Kool-Aid, or a non-carbonated green Monster energy drink. However, it's definitely better than its current counterpart Black Cherry in my humble opinion. While both have a syrup-like texture, Green Thunder is much more enjoyable. Try small amounts in clear-colored drinks such as Water, Sprite, or Sierra-Mist.<br /><br />Note, I had to dig on the internet to find the nutrient/caffeine numbers since the nutrition facts per servings are based on percentages. However, besides having zero (0) of most common facts which MiO is branded for (calories, sugar, carbs, etc.) and only 10mg of sodium, here's what I came up with for the caffeine and B-complex:<br /><br />Caffeine: 60mg (20mg less than Red Bull, and quite a few premium coffees)<br />B3 (Niacin) - 10% daily value - 1.8mg<br />B6 (Pyridoxine) - 10% daily value - 0.2mg<br />B12 (Cobalamine) - 10% daily value - 0.6Âµg (0.0006mg)<br />&lt;2% mixture of Taurine, Guarana Extract, and Ginseng Extract (Panax)<br />*Side Note: B-vitamin consumption and overdose is really a non-issue with over the counter mixtures. Over abundance in your system will usually be urinated out, and quite a few other energy supplements have 6000% to 8000% of daily value B-vitamins (5-hour).<br /><br />While it doesn't come too close to the effects of main stream energy supplements and drinks, it has about the same effect as a light homemade cup of coffee with B vitamins. It also doesn't add to you calorie count if you're mixing it with water during your morning and afternoon shifts at work. And furthermore, being in a convenient container, you can almost take it with you anywhere. Make sure you start out with small amounts if you're sensitive to caffeine.<br /><br />Bottom line: Despite the price, I recommend trying this.

I use it only raw, so I can fully appreciate its flavor.<br />I was really pleased to see it here on Amazon, at a price that is slightly lower than in any local stores.<br /><br />What a huge disappointment it was to see, upon delivery, that the bottle was cheap transparent plastic.<br /><br />Decent quality extra virgin olive oil MUST be in glass bottles or at most cans (e.g. Carli oil has some big cans along with glass bottles), even better if dark glass, because light also deteriorates its quality. I am Italian, in Italy extra virgin olive oil is a staple and people use a lot of it. But I have never seen any extra virgin oil sold in plastic, in 24 years that I\\'ve lived in Italy.<br /><br />I could not believe that they ruined the Bertolli oil storing it in cheap plastic, and the taste reflects this poor storage. It does not nearly have the same rich taste as the oil that is stored in glass. I believe this is because it has been stored for too long in that worthless bottle. It expires in 1 year so probably it was bottled about 10 months ago.<br /><br />This oil as it is in the plastic is really not worth the price, for the taste it has, you can find some better oils for lower price (while to me the Bertolli oil in glass bottles is UNBEATABLE for its rich taste, and I have tried many many oils).<br />This is why I am canceling my subscription and I am going back buying again the same oil in a local store that sells it in respectable glass bottles.<br /><br />You can google \"extra virgin olive oil plastic\" and you\\'ll find many results that advice to stay away from plastic bottles as oils absorb PVCs a lot, even at room temperature. This is unhealthy and it also affects the taste of the oil. Some people think this is no big deal because they cannot notice any difference in taste. But it is a matter of fact that, even if you cannot taste anything different, the oil deteriorates in plastic. Many other foods are perfectly fine stored in plastic, I am not against plastic at all! But not oils, especially the less refined (extra virgin) ones.',\n",
       " 'I purchased this to make \"popcorn\", which I saw on Andrew Zimmern\\'s Bizarre Foods (Ethiopia episode, season three). I placed a small pot with a lid on medium-high heat with some canola oil. I added the sorghum, and then kept the kernels moving. Amazingly, they actually started popping. I half-expected them to simply burn, but they popped quite nicely. Sorghum kernels are very small, producing a miniature \"popcorn\" that is slightly larger than an unpopped popcorn kernel. Popped sorghum has a heavier, fuller taste than regular popcorn. Best of all, there are no kernel husks in the end result... just little fluffy popped sorghum. I experimented with popping different quantities and found that keeping the amount limited works best. With larger quantities, a significant number of the kernels did not pop. However, this wasn\\'t all that bad... as the unpopped sorghum kernels were very delicious as well, not at all hard or crunchy. The unpopped kernels had a nice toasted flavor, a lot like corn nuts.<br /><br />Sorghum is one of those \"wonder grains\", that is used for everything from making sugar, molasses, animal feed, alcohol and biofuel. But, I now know that it makes a nice popcorn as well.',\n",

I didn\\'t even think to try to make pizza crust with it, as we were using a mix specifically for pizza crust from another popular gluten-free brand, which I didn\\'t really like (too light and thick like a deep dish, but without flavor).

       " 'This past December my 7-year old son was diagnosed with allergic to wheat. This is a little guy that LOVES bread !!! He is also allergic to dairy. So, I searched and tried many kinds of wheat free bread mix/recipes and he might eat 2 bites and then stopped with sad face or he would cry. He said \"it\\'s yucky, grainy, tasted bad...\". I often hid my tears, \\'cause I knew I needed to be strong for him. Once I even ordered a bread from a bakery chef, $6.50/loaf, and my son took one bite and that\\'s it!<br /><br />Then in June I checked out Amazon, and found this product. The review said it\\'s moist and not grainy, and I was so desperate, so I ordered a box of 6! That ended my search!!<br /><br />When I put the 1st loaf on the dining table, my son could not stop eating it (and of course, I cried secretly in the kitchen!). I also ordered the cake mix, and chocolate chip cookies mix. I can\\'t express how thankful I am to see my son\\'s bright eyes as he enjoys his bread. By the way, I like it too. Thank you to the people that make Pamela\\'s Products !!!!',\n",
       " \"I had high hopes for this gluten-free bread mix, and although it had many good qualities, I probably wouldn't buy it again because I didn't care for the flavor. I made it in my breadmaker and it rose nicely and held its shape reasonably well after I took it out of the machine. I let the bread cool before I cut it as all gluten free bread can fall if cut while hot, and the bread sliced very well. Each individual slice had a spongy, soft bread texture. Actually it was almost a little TOO soft for me, but those who like soft bread might enjoy it. I cut a slice and put margarine and honey on it, expecting to have a tasty bite of fresh bread- but something about the flavor bothered me, and I had difficulty enjoying it. I have had almost every kind of gluten-free bread on the market and have been gluten free for a long time, but I don't know how I feel about this new Sorghum craze. Although it yields decent nutritional value and good texture, similarly to bean flour, if there is too high of a ratio of sorghum to neutral flours (White rice, tapioca, etc.) I think that the flavor is negatively impacted. I prefer a more subtle mix, like Bette Hagman's four flour blend, which has less sorghum and thus gets the good qualities of the flour without negatively impacting flavor. I toasted the bread for sandwiches for a few days and my husband ate it without complaint (he is not gluten-free), but because I didn't like the bread and it reminded me a little of playdough, I don't think I'll buy it again. My entirely subjective opinion aside, if you are looking for an easy gluten-free bread mix for your machine, I would recommend that you try this mix, because only trial and error will help you find a bread mix that suits your palate. I prefer homemade bean flour blends, Bob's red Mill GF bread, or The gluten free Pantry's favorite sandwich bread, but you may find this mix fits the bill perfectly!<br /><br />One other note- Most of the 99 reviews listed for this item are actually NOT for this specific mix- they are for the full spectrum of Pamela's products on Amazon. So, while people like this mix- 99+ people have not (yet) rated this item.\",\n",
       " 'I discovered that I was gluten-intolerant about a year ago and have been looking for good-tasting wheat-free products ever since.  My primary roadblock has been bread - every single loaf of gluten-free bread I\\'ve tried has been beyond disgusting.  I\\'ve been to health food store after health food store and haven\\'t found a single loaf that I can eat without gagging.  I thought it was hopeless until I read the reviews of Pamela\\'s Amazing Wheat-Free Bread Mix.  I decided to give it a shot, so I borrowed my sister-in-law\\'s bread machine and fired up a loaf.<br /><br />Simply put, I was amazed at the results.  Does it taste like regular bread?  No.  Well, almost.  Is it light-years beyond any other gluten-free breads?  A hearty, resounding YES!  If you\\'ve eaten other gluten-free (GF) breads before, let me give you a comparison: it holds up better than pre-made GF bread, but it still feels like it could fall apart easily.  Putting a slice in the toaster helps with that.  It\\'s a little on the chewy side.  It tastes like it doesn\\'t have any salt in it, so adding some butter really helps.  It kind of looks like banana bread, if I were to compare textures.  Make sure to have some milk on-hand because it makes you pretty thirsty when you eat it!<br /><br />I would say this is 90% - 95% as good as \"real\" bread.  Thank goodness, my search for wheat-free bread is over!  And Amazon sells it for nearly half the price as my local health food stores!  If you\\'re the only gluten-intolerant or Celiac in your family, I would recommend picking up a bread machine.  It makes one loaf automatically.  All I did was to follow the direction on the package and the loaf came out perfectly.  It was as simple as dumping the ingredients in the machine, making sure the settings were right, and hitting the \"On\" button.  So easy, even a caveman could do it!  I put the bread machine to work at about 9pm at night and woke up the next morning to freshly-baked GLUTEN-FREE bread.  EDIBLE bread.  Awesome!  I used a older Zojirushi machine, but some of the newer models like from Breadman actually have a Gluten-Free setting on them.  There is hope for decent-tasting bread for us gluten-intolerant people!  THANK YOU Pamela\\'s Products!!',\n",

As a sandwich bread he really enjoys the plain bread recipe with about 1/3 cup of added sesame seeds in the batter and extra sprinkled on top. Since we found this mix we have stopped experimenting with the various GF recipes we have collected. It does it all and is easy to make.\",\n",

It had the right amount of sweetness for me and the flavor profile is quite simple and straightforward; nothing spicy or tricky.

I would not purchase this again at this price for any reasons that I can possibly fathom.

       " \"One of my biggest frustrations with doing Weight Watchers was always the problem of finding good chips.  I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.  I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next.\",\n",
       " \"I want to start out by saying that i thought at first that a bag with only 120 calories and 4 grams of fat (no saturated or trans) for every 20 chips was going to taste like crap. I must say that not only was i wrong, that this is my favorite BBQ chip on the market today. They are light and you cannot taste any fat or grease after eating them. That's because they aren't baked or fried, just popped as their name suggests. These chips are very easy to dip as well. FANTASTIC PRODUCT!\",\n",

I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip.  The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor.  The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they\\'re almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their \"original\" flavor...I can\\'t imagine what the \"Salt & Pepper\" style must be like.<br /><br />I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.  Because of the salt factor, I don\\'t think you can call these a \"healthy\" alternative to chips.',\n",

Thing is, unless Amazon wrapped the cans to the case flats, this was not an Amazon issue.  The case pack was well buffered in a larger box that was completely undamaged; neither the shrink-wrap nor the flat were damaged; and even the inner cans in the case were bashed up.<br /><br />This clearly indicates that the manufacturer -- or whomever wrapped the cases -- shipped already and obviously damaged cans.

I guess I should have expected that.  It feels fairly light on the tongue, not that oily mouth coating feel you get from regular coconut water.

It is a good buy and you should not be shy at purchasing.  It's really about a 3 star minus or 2.5 stars.<br /><br />The Not So Good:  Grade B syrup is normally 'mapley' with caramel notes.  This syrup LACKS the strong maple flavors that make it suitable for cooking or a good match for those who like strong flavors, but it does NOT have the complexity or finesse of a Grade A Amber.  In short it is rather bland and pedestrian for maple syrup.  What we don't know is whether the trees tapped for this label vary from year to year but this batch is uninteresting.  I bought it as an alternative to Whole Foods label (about $20) but quite frankly the Whole Foods Grade A Amber has a stronger maple flavor with more complexity and the Whole Foods Grade B is significantly stronger in flavor.

I am going to increase it to two stars because I used it as a tea additive to give a nice acetic flavor and the anti-oxidants.<br /><br />  My explanation of the lack of flavor is that they picked the younger hibiscus flowers that have the deep color and acidity but didn't develop the real hibiscus taste yet.

I wrote to the seller about this matter and through Amazon but I did not receive a response from the seller. In my case, I ordered 6 Equal dispensers which amounts to $17.34 but then I was charged $11.94 for shipping [$1.99 for 'each' dispenser] even though they were shipped together in a single package with very negligible package weight. I asked the seller to perhaps consider [no matter who orders the product] a more reasonable [read: equitable] shipping and handling charge based on the actual weight of the package and the fact that the multiple item order is shipped in one single package, but as I said, and to date, I received no response from the seller.<br /><br />So too, various of these dispensers have tablet jamming problems and you've got to often bang on the thing to get the small tablet out in one piece. Further, it's difficult to find these tablet dispensers in supermarkets, the why of which escapes me, but when they first came out, the dispenser had a small lid on the bottom and the tablets came out intact and freely but when the Equal folks moved to the newer tablet 'click' dispensers, the tablet jamming became a problem and this 'may' account for the Equal folks going with the sweetener 'granule' or sweetener 'powder' packets for their sweetener vs the hard tablet dispensers.<br /><br />I think charging $1.99 for 'each' dispenser but which is shipped in a 'single' package borders on shipping and handling fee inequity. In the future, I'll simply order the dispensers one by one and 'then' I can at least justify the seller shipping and handling charge even though I'll wind up paying the same but it would then have to be sent in multiple packages!

This product is a perfect example. It sells at normal MSRP for $9.99/lb in Austin TX in WholeFoods or SunHarvest, yet amazon price is $16.67/lb for a bulk pack? In fact this trend is true in many of the departments. Amazon needs to start showing prices that are real rather than try to \"show\" a big discount. A good mindset to follow would be that of Costco/Sams rather than a shady pawn show.<br /><br />Fix it, and amazon\\'s subscription business for groceries & household utilities will take off like you wouldn\\'t belove it.

       " \"Chances are if you are looking at Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance, you are looking into finding a quality cat food for you animals.  I'm a firm believer in buying the best quality foods for my animals in order to ensure their optimum good health, especially since the 2007 pet food recalls from melamine adulterated food.  Initially, when I purchased this food that didn't factor into my decision.<br /><br />I had a long-haired cat who gifted me with hairballs on a frequent basis.  A friend told me about this food and swore by it, claiming her rugs and furniture no longer suffered from constant scrubbing.  I decided to give Natural Balance a try and was amazed at the results.  I no longer have that cat, but did inherit another long-haired cutie pie who LOVES this food.  I changed her food to this one a month ago, gradually mixing it with her previous food, and it somehow helps her body minimize the hairball activity.  I want her to be healthy and happy and find the expense to be well worth it.  This is brief blurb from their website, information that can be found on the bag as well:<br /><br />*  Fresh Chicken, Salmon Meal, New Zealand Lamb Meal This unique blend of fresh, high quality proteins provides the essential amino acids to help maintain strong muscle tone and a healthy, shiny coat.<br /><br />*  Taurine Fortified To help maintain a healthy heart and good vision.<br /><br />*  Fresh Potatoes Rich in potassium and an excellent source of highly digestible carbohydrates.<br /><br />*  Preserved Naturally To maintain freshness, Natural Balance uses only mixed tocopherols (Vitamin E) in all of its formulas and will always be free of artificial flavors, colors and chemical preservatives.<br /><br />*  Skin and Coat Essential Fatty Acids are combined to produce an excellent skin and coat for your cat.<br /><br />*  High Digestibility<br /><br />No Artificial Preservatives, Flavors, Colors, or Bleached Ingredients.<br /><br />If you need to find out more, you can check out this food at Petco, where I purchased it, or head to the Natural Balance website.  Of course everyone has their own opinion and will look at several factors when purchasing for their animals.  You and only you know your needs, but I find that this food satisfies not only mine (I don't have to invest in so many paper towels), but obviously that of my cat.  I was using a perfectly acceptable organic food, but when I mixed this with it ... well, lets just say she likes Natural better than organic.  I'm happy if she's happy and I'm not constantly cleaning up after her these days!\",\n",
       " 'I first switched to this food for my senior cats who both had cancer (most likely from my feeding them cheap food all their lives - never again). Within days of starting my cancer-cats on this food they both perked up, gained weight, and actually maintained the last few months of their lives in an active and normal manner. Both of course finally succumbed to cancer, but even the vet was surprised at how long they lived after diagnosis, and how brief the period of their final decline was (they both sort of bottomed out within a two day period at the end).<br /><br />Now, the other piece: I had purchased another Siamese upon learning of my other cats\\' illness, and he not only loved them, he also loved the Natural Balance food, which was all he got. I noticed that as he grew he was not anemic looking as most siamese are, but actually had good muscle tone. When I brought him for his first vet checkup the vet said, and I quote \"In 20 years, this is the healthiest looking Siamese cat I have ever seen.\" She commented on his physique, muscle tone, activity level, coat, etc. I later adopted a Tabby the same age as the Siamese, and got the same response. Both cats just have sleek, beautiful coats, are very athletic and energetic, and love the Natural Balance food.<br /><br />I firmly believe that this food (and I now also use Blue Buffalo Wilderness for some variety) has made a real and noticeable differnce in the health and quality of life of my cats, and I highly recommend it to anyone. I will say my cats don\\'t care for the wet Natural Balance foods, so I supplement their diet with an occasional Fancy Feast flavor that is free of glutens and fillers (you can Google for the list. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Addendum 4/12/10: My cats have changed their minds about the NB wet food and really enjoy it now. The key is to switch around the flavors.<br /><br />Addendum 4/22/11: have since adopted two more shelter cats, one a snowshoe siamese, the other a sable burmese. After each being on Natural Balance for about five months, the Snowshoe has a fur coat that is silky and beautiful; the little Burmese has a sleek shiny coat. Both have loads of energy.

She absolutely loves the flavor, but because the rawhide is so thin, she tears them in half and tries to swallow them in large pieces.  The first time she did it, I thought maybe it was a one time deal.  I saw her choking and stuck my hand down her throat to remove a piece of rawhide blocking her throat.  Just today, she choked again, and I wasn\\'t able to pull it out but in my efforts I must have shoved it down and she could breath again.  It is a very scary moment to see your dog choking and gasping for air.  My dog was looking to me for help and once her throat cleared she laid in my lap for 30 minutes...I am guessing it traumatized her.  I threw the rest of the bag in the trash.  My dog also has loose stool whenever she ate these, but she does have a sensitive stomach to certain foods so I am sure results will vary.

I just wanted to edit this review because the risk is so high with these chews that I felt compelled to warn potential buyers of the product.<br /><br />I think the manufacturer should at a minimum put a strong warning on the front of the bag to warn owners that this can pose a major choking hazard to some dogs.  This would be the responsible thing to do.  Pet products are not regulated like products for human use.  Most people like me view their pets as children and essential to their lives.  If this were made for children, the danger of this product would make news and force the manufacturer to address the choking hazard.<br /><br />It also seems fishy that almost all of the 5 star reviews are from people with 1-4 reviews on other products.  Plus the number of \"is this useful votes\" is usually less than 5 votes.  It seems as these reviewers are fake...just seems fishy to me.

The first time I easily pulled it out of her throat but today it almost killed her. I should have known better because I'd been told as much by many people at my vets (one dog even choked to death) but the reviews online were so good I didn't listen. I always watch my dog with chews but even under supervision she will try and swallow them ASAP. These are great for your dogs teeth but please watch your dog!<br /><br />Also, the sizes are very inconsistent... in the four bags I've ordered to date I've had to throw a large number out (basically one full bags worth) because they are too small to even attempt to give to my dog.\",\n",

The amount of rice noodles is substantial.  The package makes a good size meal for two.  I add my own chicken pieces or shrimp along with some green onions, and if I have some broccoli, I'll throw that in as well.  This is a great item to keep in your pantry for when you want something different and exotically tasty.\",\n",
       " '****Latest Update****<br /><br />We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months. Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth\\'s Best. It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself. The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy... and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well. All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased, though I will say, she didn\\'t seem to like these gourmet ones any better or any worse than the less expensive <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM6LVS\">Earth\\'s Best Organic 2nd Dinner Variety Pack, 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read a review about BPA in the lids at <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM395E\">Earth\\'s Best Organic 2nd Fruit Variety Pack, 4-Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>, (and so I posted my review there as well).  I spent some time trying to verify this myself. A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn\\'t find anything definitive, here\\'s what bothered me: Clearly Earth\\'s Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids... their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question. The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss. That\\'s only slightly paraphrased. Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either... nothing. I\\'m not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents\\' concerns and tell parents... something. Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns... just say something... anything. Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?<br /><br />As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain. Something, I likely wouldn\\'t have done if I wasn\\'t writing a review. Their office was closed... 9AM - 7PM est. Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.<br /><br />****UPDATED (old)****<br />Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  I\\'m sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I\\'m ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer that\\'s readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least.',\n",

I assumed that since I was paying over $20 for shipping--the absolute fastest time, greater care would be taken to ensure that the product arrived intact.  Unfortunately, the chocolates I received were largely melted.  I do not recommend the purchase of this item to be shipped to any region experiencing temperatures above 78 degrees.<br /><br />UPDATE: Received an e-mail, which read (in part) as follows: First, my apologies for not answering you earlier... I didn't notice there was a melting issue with your order till late last week while addressing a small more recent delivery problem.  Anyway, as you have noticed with your order, melting can and does happen in transit, but luckily only with an insignificant number of our packages as we only experience about two dozen or three dozen a year out of well over 15,000 packages. Insignificant when view in percentage terms, but still most infuriating when this happens.<br /><br />The e-mail went on to note that they are replacing my order.  I am stunned--I have had a melting issue before with a different chocolate company (remember, I live in Atlanta, Georgia, where summer temperatures are a bear), and I received nothing in the way of satisfaction.  I figured it would be the same and didn't even bother to directly contact the company (a mistake on my part).  I am *very* pleased with this level of service.\",\n",
       " 'If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur.<br /><br />When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress.<br /><br />The \"I Love You\" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites.<br /><br />Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection:<br /><br />Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache<br /><br />Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.<br /><br />Irr&eacute;sistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.<br /><br />For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy\\'s RÃªverie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.<br /><br />Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.<br /><br />Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.<br /><br />Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.<br /><br />Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.<br /><br />Po&eacute;sie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.<br /><br />Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.<br /><br />Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.<br /><br />Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.<br /><br />Also Recommended:<br /><br />If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I\\'d suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d\\'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.<br /><br />Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.<br /><br />My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review',\n",

The general assortment is an outstanding sampling of ivory, milk and dark chocolate.  If you love dark chocolate then go for the dark chocolate assortment.  You will not regret it.  Also forget Godiva - it\\'s medium grade quality.',\n",

This salt has a very prounced aftertaste, the kind you find with cheap table salt.  I took this bag over to my sister who had the real pink salt.  Side by side we could see and defintely taste that this wasn't the real stuff.  We concluded that it must be a very small amount of pink salt added in for color and mixed with regular table and sea salt. Again, the aftertaste is very strong, something you NEVER taste with the genuine Himalayan pink salt- one of the many reasons people pay so much for it. And this defintely ISN'T it.<br /><br />(FYI- In San Francisco, Rainbow Grocery has it for a great price in the bulk section.

Friends not on the gluten-free diet raved about it too.<br /><br />Not any more.  The formula used for the mix seems to have changed along with the instructions - making it easier to put together (no more baking the crust first, as we used to do, before adding toppings), but resulting in an inferior product.  It\\'s lost the chewy texture and the great taste and is now just another over-priced GF mix - one package makes one medium-sized pizza.<br /><br />If you make it, oil your pizza pan (something that never used to be necessary) before putting the dough in it, or the pizza will stick.  And don\\'t pile the toppings too high or add too much sauce, or the dough won\\'t bake through in the middle.  If you\\'re lucky, you\\'ll get a fairly edible pizza - but you could make a good bigger pizza for less just using the pizza dough recipe in a good GF cookbook - e.g., Elizabeth Barbone\\'s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1891105418\">Easy Gluten-Free Baking</a>.

This product isn't designed for concentrated use. (If you DO get violet extract, you can make your own violet syrup. 1 part sugar, 1 part water.

Once the simple has cooled, you can add your favorite extract drop by drop until you're satisfied with the flavor.)\",\n",

However, there's a LOT of saturated fat.  That's a concern because if you're a normal healthy adult, you could easily eat a package of these in one sitting (only 5 ounces!)...in which case you would have had about your week's worth of saturated fat in one sitting!

However, your Honor, since there\\'s a nutritional debate among these reviews, I\\'d like to enter into evidence the incontrovertible the facts right off this 5.3 ounce package OF \"HITs\" that I hold in my hand.<br /><br /> Exhibit A.<br /><br />The following shows the amount and percent of the recommended daily allowance (rda) of one serving - that\\'s two HIT cookies, or 27 grams--based on a 2,000 calorie/day diet.In one serving (two cookies (27 grams):<br /><br />Calories per serving: 140, total fat =7 grams (11%), Saturated fat=6 grams (29%), Cholesterol, 0 grams; sodium, 75 mg (3%); and 17 grams (6%) of carbohydrates, including 1 gram (3%) of  dietary fiber and 9 grams of sugar--and two grams of protein. You also get 2%  of the RDA of Calcium, and 4% of iron.<br /><br />Exhibit B:<br /><br />Compare this to \"one serving\" or two (28 grams) cookies of wheat-free/dairy free, mostly organic Newman O\\'s (a somewhat healthier version of the classic OREO): Total fat (4.5 grams), Saturated fat (1.5 g). Trans fat (0 g), calories (130), sugar (10.0 grams), Total Carbohydrates, (31.5g), dietary fiber (1 g), protein (2 g), sodium (85 mg), no cholesterol, iron (8%).<br /><br />Nutritional conclusion (As always, consult  your physician!):<br /><br />Newman\\'s beats the pants off HIT  in total fat, saturated fat (HIT has 4 times as much), twice as much of the RDA of iron but has over twice as many carbohydrates, and minimally more sugar and sodium.<br /><br />Style points:<br /><br />I can see Audrey Hepburn eating a HIT bar (without the bright wrapper) or something like it, served on a silver platter, with Italian coffee or perhaps some tea.  I cannot see her, unless she\\'s slumming it in \"Roman Holiday\" eating an Oreo, even one owned by an actor as great as Paul Newman.

The dark chocolate is very rich, not bitter, and completely covers the orange peel (which retains a good flavor and isn\\'t overly sweet).  Unlike other chocolatiers who often dip the peel only partially, Leonidas has made certain to put their chocolate center stage by using a generous portion.  The result is an addictive treat because the flavors linger on the palate and the Orangettes aren\\'t so sweet as to become cloying.<br /><br />I don\\'t know if these guys are really going to improve your health, but they will definitely improve your day.

You can drop a quantity of The Vegg (once mixed with water) into a 1% (by weight) solution of calcium chloride and the liquid will form a ball with a membrane around it - which looks and tastes just like an uncooked egg yolk.  Try placing a spherified Vegg yolk in the center of a ravioli with some tofu ricotta or sweet potato filling - vegan gourmet for sure!  Just this weekend I saw calcium chloride granules on sale at Lowe's - Ball brand packages them for use with canning.

IT was a crippling blow to my diet as I literally went into anxiety mode everytime I saw pasta in a tv show, commercial, movie, read about it...hell, I almost had a breakdown while watching \"Lady and the Tramp\".<br /><br />Almost as a joke I Googled \"zero carb pasta\" just to laugh at myself but something unexpected happened. No, Google did not grow a hand and smack me for being stupid, it actually returned the Miracle Noodle page in the results.<br /><br />I was skeptical...who wouldn\\'t be? It is simply not possible to get a real pasta experience from a plant.  Or so I thought!  On a whim and without doing a terrible amount of research I ordered a ten pack of angel hair noodles. 70 glorious ounces of zero carb/zero calorie noodly goodness.<br /><br />For the record, the following is true:<br /><br />They stink.  Yes, there is an odor when you open the package due to fermenting, but once the noodles are washed and boiled the smell is gone and there is no foul taste associated with the smell.<br /><br />They are flavorless.  Yes, they don\\'t have a starchy flavor so common in pasta and noodles because they are not made from starch. They are simply plant fiber.<br /><br />They have a rubbery texture.  Sort of, but if you follow the instructions this is minimized and the end result is on par with a toothsome al dente pasta. It is not like chewing on rubber bands.<br /><br />The noodles do take on the flavor of whatever you cook them in, sort of similar to the way tofu operates. Because of this, I recommend not using the noodles as you would spaghetti. If you boil your noodles and cover them in pasta sauce you are setting yourself up for disappointment, and the makers of the product know this, hence they give you a recipie booklet to take full advantage of the power of the noodle.<br /><br />I usually make a spicy stir fry in szechuan sauce and add the noodles at the last moments and allow the noodles to absorb the peppery sauce.  The entirte dish has only 4 grams of carbs and is filling.<br /><br />Let\\'s not forget that the noodles are a great source of fiber!<br /><br />Do not go into the order process expecting spaghetti or egg noodles.

Patting the noodles dry (I use paper towels) before adding your favorite topping is a must!! This keeps them from becoming slimy. If you have left overs, they reheat wonderfully!! In fact I find everything taste better the next day.<br />The texture is definitely different from egg noodles. They are kind of like gummy worms without any flavor. The noodles absorb the flavor of whatever you top them with.

The first bite was OK but after a few more bites, it was disgusting, not because of the taste because you cannot taste the noodles, it was because of the texture. It really was like rubber bands like all the other reviewers said.<br /><br />So i kept experimenting, and realized that after rinsing 4-5 minutes, you have to boil it in hot water for 5-7 minutes, then rinse them in cold water again for a minute.

Which they do very well when boiling over 30min.<br />They are great for HCG dieters which I currently am on.<br />A lil trick I just learned was after I boil about 2 to 3 bags I put them away and eat as needed.<br />So I would take a piece of my allowed HCG diet food IE 3.5 oz meat or veggie or both.<br />Take Pam and cut up a few pieces of onion and pan fry the noodles, onion and meat or veggies.  YUMM!!<br />A complete meal cal count of 8cal to 95cal and you feel full.  Can't beat that.  Good Luck! :)\",\n",
       " \"How do you make these delicious?<br /><br />Hold your nose, snip the bag open and pour into a colindar with your faucet on hot full blast; if you have a spray option use it to cover the noodles better.  I let this rinse and drain in the hot water for a full minute, agitating the noodles the whole time to REALLY rinse them well.  I then put them in a salad spinner and spin them dry.  I place them in a bowl and nuke for 90 seconds, then I give them another spin to get them dry again.  While still hot, I place them in a big bowl and cover with a zesty pasta sauce, stir and let them sit for several minutes while I boil pasta for my hubby and daughter.  When their's is ready, I sprinkle mine with cheese, add a few meatballs and nuke again until very hot.  We all get a spagetti dinner on the table at the same time and I get to keep my plate well under 10 carbs.<br /><br />Prepared this way, I think they taste very good.  I also do a spicy Thai peanut sauce that I also have the noodles sit in before heating and enjoying with grated carrots, sliced green onions and shredded cabbage.  I think it is important to really let the noodles rest in the sauce of your choice so they have a chance to absorb flavor.  If you do not do this, they taste awful!  I just rinsed and heated them the first time I had them and hated them.  I went through the above process to rid them of the packing water, which is the element I couldn't like.  I am not bothered by the texture because I dress them with a lot of textures so I never notice them tasting different.  I would not cook these and dress with only butter and cheese, you need to bury them a bit in a hearty dish.  I have snipped these smaller and made a great tuna casserole that my family liked too.<br /><br />I have not tried the fetaccini cut, but the smaller angel hair melds easily into dishes, a thicker noodle may be more rubbery.<br /><br />If you spend the prep time they are great!\",\n",
       " \"these aren't as bad as the fettucini noodles. Again, no flavor making them versatile and easy to put in many dishes. The texture is still rubbery and chewy, but they aren't as thick as the fettucini so for myself they are more tolerable. They do in fact fill you up quickly!\",\n",
       " \"I was very apprehensive about the noodles, but they are really great!<br />I got the angel hair style, and they are just like Asian cellophane noodles.<br />I personally wouldn't use the angel hair style with a marinara sauce, as I can't imagine they would hold up to that heavy sauce.  I made them with fresh tomatoes, basil & mozzarella with a tiny bit of olive oil and it was delicious!<br />Again, much like a cellophane noodle, they soak up whatever sauce you cook them with.<br /><br />They come packaged in water, and they say to rinse them then drop them in boiling water.  When you first put them in the colander, they do have a slight odor, but this dissipates as soon as you rinse them, and have no flavor.<br /><br />Totally worth it!  Saves you so many calories.\",\n",
       " \"When I discovered these noodles in 2006, I was really excited.  But, I had no idea how to cook them in a way that'd make me want to actually eat them.  The liquid they're packed in stinks, they have a very strange consistency, and they have no flavor.  It took me about a year to figure it out.<br /><br />Drain the noodles and rinse them really well.  Place them in a microwave safe bowl and microwave them (I use the potato setting).  After the first round, drain them in a colander and check the texture, do they still have water in the noodles?  If so, put them back into the microwave and zap them again.  This process removes all of the liquid, and gives the noodles an actual pasta texture and consistency.  And, it allows them to reabsorb whatever sauce you're pairing them with to give them flavor.<br /><br />Once they're ready, you can combine them with ingredients to throw in the oven for an amazing tuna casserole, or throw them into a reduced pasta sauce for an amazing dry spaghetti, or add them at the end of cooking a phad thai.\",\n",

They do have a scent when open but that goes away once you rinse under cold water as the cooking instructions states.  I wouldn't recommend eating these noodles by itself.  Instead, add to a pasta sauce, a salad dressing or soup and it'll taste fine.  They absorb the sauce very well.  Perhaps the best thing about them is they make you feel full after eating just one 7oz package.\",\n",

Really an individual portion for most appetites.  The price I think was a bit high--17 per package--when I bought.  At 14 bucks/6pack its a better deal...just as good as you\\'ll find at your local asian grocery.<br /><br />For you paleo types out there, it went well with \"italian sauce\" (ie, ground turkey sauteed with onions in tomato sauce).

       " \"After reading the review about dented cans, I was leery to buy 2 cases from Amazon but I am glad I did! I received all 24 cans, and NONE were dented. I was pleasantly surprised! The milk worked for my thai curry quite well, but I just wish it was a bit thicker. While this milk is not as thick as the Mae Ploy brand I have tried in the past, I feel better knowing it was organically grown and that this particular company does not use BPA in their cans for coconut milk, or several other of their products. If more companies jump on the bandwagon I will try more brands but until then I am sticking with Native Forest.<br /><br />Added Aug 15th 2011:<br />I now see lots of negative reviews on this product due to sourcing from both Sri Lanka and Thailand. Reviewers have stated the poor quality watery ones are coming from Sri Lanka, which makes sense why I rated mine a 4 and liked mine, because mine were the Thailand kind that like other reviewers have stated, taste great. So be careful when ordering this product and make sure you get the Thailand kind! (will say this on the back of the label) As there is no way to know which Amazon is shipping out, it seems the best bet is to get them in a local store and check the back and get the good sourcing of coconut milk that will say Thailand.<br /><br />Added Oct 20th, 2012:<br />As commenters have posted as a response to my review, you are able to purchase a powder that you can mix with hot water if you wish to avoid cans and BPA at Wilderness Family Naturals website.<br /><br />Another option is the Tropical Traditions website shows how to make coconut milk with dried coconut at home. (They sell organic dried coconut on their website, so avoiding cans, less packaging, ethical sourcing) They sell quality coconut products, I have purchased many of their items.<br /><br />Lastly, I read recently on someone's blog that you can use the coconut cream concentrate found on the Tropical Traditions website to make coconut milk, that it is very cost effective. I have not ever tried this, however I add a bit to smoothies for my partner in the summer and he loves the taste. If I ever try these things out I will report back, however I just wanted to give ideas to folks who might see this if they do not want to go the canned milk route. :)\",\n",

It is from Skri Lanka, instead.<br />ALSO, the product I received from Skri Lanka was in the old style yellow lined (Phenol lined?) cans-the yellow kind with the white stripe down the side that theoretically products you from the metals they use to seal the can!

Wrote the manufacturer - here's the reply<br /><br />From the manufacturer:<br />Thank you for writing. Due to worldwide surging demand for coconut<br />milk during its lean harvest season, our primary organic packer in<br />Thailand is unable to keep up with our volume of sales. Therefore we<br />have added a trusted organic coconut facility in Sri Lanka as our<br />secondary supplier. Unfortunately, Sri Lanka uses a slightly different<br />processing method than Thailand does and the Sri Lankan product has<br />more tendency to separate when its temperature falls below 80 degrees<br />F. This makes the milk appear curdled as the coconut fat separates<br />from the liquid. Such separation is harmless and easily remedied by<br />placing the can of coconut milk in hot water for 15 minutes and then<br />stirring the contents thoroughly. We regret this inconvenience,<br />especially since consumers have come to really value the smoother,<br />creamier consistency of our Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk. While<br />all natural and organic coconut milk will separate in cool<br />temperatures, the Thailand milk is more smooth and homogeneous. Faced<br />with lengthy stock shortages during an exceptionally lean coconut<br />season, we decided to accept the different coconut milk consistencies<br />from two supply lines rather than have no organic coconut milk at all<br />during this six month lean period. We are only shipping Thai sourced<br />coconut milk<br />as of right now, but distributors and stores may still have Sri Lankan<br />sourced product.<br /><br />Thank you for your patience and your understanding.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Joanna Freet<br />Edward & Sons Trading Co., Inc.\",\n",

It now being February 2012, I decided to give them another shot. I'm SO glad that I did, too, because theirs is easily the best coconut milk I've ever had--now that it's properly sourced from Thailand, that is. Those of you who were concerned about getting any from Sri Lanka should be safe now. Additionally, it seems that while they once weren't accepting returns for this item, you can get a replacement if the cans are dented and you call Amazon. And if they're from Sri Lanka, you can be sure they're going to be dented!<br /><br />Old (1 star) review:<br />Another warning for anyone who orders this: if you get the cans from Sri Lanka, they WILL be watery, and they WILL be dented, and they're NOT eligible for a return.<br />You have been warned.\",\n",

I read the reviews talking about dented cans but ordered anyway. Some that I buy at the grocery store are dented so I didn't feel it was a big deal either way. I received my case today and not a single can was dented.<br /><br />Regarding the reviewer talking about the expiration date - please disregard. They do not understand the coding system that is used. As explained in my reply to that comment, the date code is a production code and is six letters. Those that I received today were BAAJCH which corresponded to a production date of September 10, 2009. This is only 5 months ago.<br /><br />Also the same reviewer talking about solids in the can may not realize that when coconut milk is colder (below 76 degrees), the oil will solidify. If you want it all liquid and smooth put the can in a pan of warm water for a while.<br /><br />This is an excellent product, even better with Amazon's special pricing and free shipping for recurring orders.

Completely different product and the watered down cans just don't produce as nice a product in the kitchen :(.  Beware.\",\n",

I shook the cans thoroughly before I opened them, but you can see the oily floating at the top.  The milk separates when in the fridge with the coconut oil forming a thick layer on top.

The woman I spoke to was an absolute brat, borderline rude, with excuse after excuse. Maybe she was tired of fielding complaints, but isnt' that her job?

I just wanted to let them know about the problem.<br /><br />Her biggest excuse (among several side-stepping maneuvers) is that the sample sent to them did not match the product. To me this speaks VOLUMES about the lack of quality control at the company. Makes me wonder what is in those cans.

It seemed like very, VERY watered down coconut milk with coconut oil added to it. The result was a liquid with oil solids (translucent like coconut oil) throughout. It didn\\'t matter how much I shook the can (or heated the unopened can in hot water before shaking) it was a disgusting, unusable, oily slop! If I refrigerated an open can the oil would rise to the top and form a solid top layer.

       " \"I was reluctant to buy this product because of all the bad reviews and I thought maybe all the good reviews were put there by the families of the team who concocted this product. Just the other day, my co-worker gave me a chocolate brownie made with erythritol and I enjoyed it and I waited for a weird aftertaste and I waited for any laxative effect. Neither. I was the grocery store today and I picked up some sugar-free Oreos and then I saw this bottle of sugar-free Hershey's chocolate syrup and then I instantly thought back to all these reviews.<br /><br />  As a lowcarber, I use stevia in my soy milk, my hemp milk, my tea and my coffee. I think stevia is TERRIBLE with chocolate. All the chocolate products out there are usually made with maltitol and sucralose mix, which I do enjoy. So, if there was such a product out there like this, I would buy it. I don't have the explosive diarrhea or upset stomach or other related episodes that other people have with maltitol. Maybe they consume A LOT more than I, or maybe I'm special. Having tried recently the chocolate brownie, I thought what the heck.<br /><br />  I mixed in three teaspoons of syrup into my soy milk and I absolutely thought it was GREAT AND DELICIOUS! Those naysayers were exaggerating! The flavor was not as sweet as I expected, but that's okay since most commercial products are way too sweet, just like the sugar-free chocolates on the market. So, I thought it was genius that it was just sweet enough. And when you go low carb, everything starts to taste too sweet and obnoxious after awhile.<br /><br />  I did notice a slight bitter aftertaste that was not attributable to natural chocolate. The bitterness was fleeting and not unpleasant, so I didn't mind it. The lingering taste in my mouth is a slightly sweet chocolate, not a chemical taste. The aftertaste didn't taste natural though, so if you're the organics-only type, then you should not buy it.<br /><br />  I was ready to side with all the five-star-raters but I wanted to be sure, so I took a teaspoon of chocolate syrup and ate it straight. All of a sudden, all the one-star-raters were right: it was sour!!! So, these people were right too! It tastes terrible out of the bottle.<br /><br />  So, I say this to all of you, if you are a lowcarber or a diabetic and you're looking for a chocolate treat in the form of a drink like chocolate milk, for example (though milk has carbs so why would you want to drink milk? Add it to unsweetened soy milk or hemp milk), then by all means get this. It's great. Whatever you do, don't be tempted to eat it or pour it down your throat. Otherwise, you will think it's gone bad and you will throw out a treasure and close your world off to sugar-free chocolate syrups forever.<br /><br />  Sure, Hershey is trying to make money out of an increasingly hard niche market to cater to, but at least they know about you and your needs and are trying to make you happy. I thank Hershey's for that. So, give this product a chance. And until they come out with an organic, carb-free, non-diarrhea-inducing syrup with a pleasant aftertaste and mouth feel, this is a compromise I can deal with. I hope you will try it and see the value in a product like this.\",\n",

       " 'I think switching formulas is becoming a popular past-time of new parents these days, and when I look back on our experience with our first baby I\\'m almost ashamed at how frantically we switched her formulas around, searching for an answer to her gassy, colicky behavior. I think in total we tried 7 or 8, from powder to ready-to-feed, hoping that one would be a magical formula that eased her tummy (and our eardrums) during her fussy evening hours.<br /><br />Unfortunately, none of those formulas worked magic. It ended up being that our daughter\\'s belly really did just need to grow & mature before she could readily digest formula, and even the hypo-allergenic ones made little difference in her spit-up or tummy achin\\' behavior.<br /><br />However, Similac Sensitive was always our fall-back formula because it seemed to cause the least amount of stomach upset, didn\\'t smell as horrible as some of the others, and with the coupons they send out (from StrongMoms) - it was surprisingly affordable for the most part. Strangely, our daughter would only drink ready-to-feed and would never finish a powder-prepared bottle and did seem more gassy after those. So we had to bite our bottom lips and put out the extra money for the liquid, which though expensive, was also very handy on trips and during late night feedings.<br /><br />Similac Sensitive still has a small amount of lactose in it, but it\\'s broken down more than Similac Advance so it\\'s easier to digest. And since it\\'s already sterilized in the bottle, there are none of those new-parent worries over your powdered formula being contaminated or washing your hands before every bottle you make/feed. Trust me, when you\\'re running on 2 hours of sleep, these \"simple pleasures\" can really make a big difference. I also called Similac\\'s customer service on several occasions to ask questions and they were polite and helpful, and even sent coupons!<br /><br />We used Similac Sensitive until our daughter was ready to transition to cow\\'s milk, and although we tried cheaper versions and many other formulas in an attempt to save money, we could never find anything our baby would take as easily as Similac Sensitive, so we stuck by it and would do so with the next baby should the need arise.<br /><br />**********UPDATE**********<br />We just had our second child and immediately skipped all other formulas and went straight to Similac Sensitive. This has saved so much trouble from the first time around! Baby #2 is doing great on this formula, however, he has been diagnosed with Acid Reflux. This means feedings are very difficult and painful. The only alternative to try from this formula is Nutramigen, but its too expensive. We are giving baby #2 Zantac prescribed from his pediatrictian and it seems to be helping.<br /><br />It wasn\\'t mentioned before, but if your baby is taking Similac Sensitive, but still having a lot of spit up or acts differently on the powder vs RTF. This is probably because the RTF is much thicker and babies are able to handle it better. The RTF is also much easier to digest than the powdered version because the nutrients have been fully dissolved 100% into liquid. However, with the powder, baby\\'s belly may have to work a little harder to process the powder. Because our children have acid reflux, powder is not an option. The less spit up, the better because stomach acid is brought back up into the esophagus the more they spit up.',\n",

We like sensitive because it is gentler on the stomach than regular formula so for the price this is a good buy.<br /><br />Only thing that has been spotty is the shipping, generally the package comes very quick, usually in 3 days from order but sometimes longer. The packaging has been strange also, the first order came in a big plastic bag with no padding. The box was breaking open and 2 bottles had dents on them. The formula seemed ok but was a strange package indeed. The second came in a regular box over another box and was much better padded.

After 2 weeks he would barely walk around. Several tests later the vet found that his intestines were swollen along with his stomach lymph nodes & he had developed pancreatitis. He's off the food now but still recouping. Apparently my cat isn't the only one with problems recently with the Limited Ingredient dry crunchies according to reviews on consumeraffairs.com! Customers on there have the same complaints with the cat & dog dry L.I.D food over the past few months of it doing the same thing to their animals too! Natural Balance doesn't have my business any more, that is until they no longer have Diamond Pet Foods package their products. After doing some background research on Natural Balance, Diamond Pet Foods (who packages for them) has constant recalls & complaints. They have one going on right now actually & were one of the biggest culprits during the 2007 major pet food recall.  Just keep an eye on your pets if you purchase this, and also watch for a runny nose or sneezing, my cat no longer does either since taking him off of this food.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />Five Stars!!!! One of my cats has a very sensitive stomach but does VERY well on these crunchies! And my other cat had bad dandruff but after a couple of months on this food its completely gone! Her coat looks beautiful and she doesn't frantically lick her back anymore! Both of my cats seemed to prefer this flavor over the salmon L.I.D but all cats are different. So glad Natural Balance makes this!\",\n",

It is great for her sensitive stomach and she just loves the food. Her coat condition has also improved. Great product.',\n",

They are high in calories (200), fat (8g) and carbs (34g), they have essentially no vitamin content either.

The only ingredients that might be healthy are the raisins and the oats. I eat Zone nutrition bars and Kellog\\'s Fiber Plus bars. Both taste much better and contain far more healthy ingredients.<br /><br />I read the hype on the side of the box and whoever wrote it could not have been writing about these \"Eat Think Smile\" bars.

On the boxes I received \"Artificial Flavor\" is the third ingredient!<br />Good Earth was recently purchased by the Tata Beverage Group. Apparently they have chosen to enhance their profit on what used to be a quality, 100% Natural product by using inferior ingredients.

Upon speaking with The Good Earth directly, I have learned that the 18-count Original Sweet & Spicy Tea (both caffeine-free and regular) have artificial flavor, whereas the 25-count boxes do not. It seems like a stupid way to differentiate, since the boxes look exactly the same, with the same exact name. I think they do this so as not to highlight the fact that any of their products have artificial flavoring. I learned from them that they originally had artificial flavor in the blend, then removed it, and received complaints because it tasted different (though probably only slightly). They then added it back to their formula, but only in the 18-count boxes. It is a \"spice flavor not found in nature,\" they claim, so I guess there\\'s no other way to please the people who like that flavor. The first box I got was from an outlet grocery store that was produced during the in-between period when the artificial flavor had been removed from all boxes. It was really good just like that; I still enjoyed the flavor of the new version (technically the old version) that I received from Amazon, but actually not quite as much, and I\\'d rather have the natural version since it\\'s natural and I like that one anyway.<br /><br /> As a note about the flavor--I really like this tea. It is, as described, sweet and spicy. It has a very cinnamon-y flavor with a lot of dimension added by all the other flavors included. I drink a few cups a day, either caffeinated or the rooibos version, depending on time of day. The flavor between these two are slightly different, but comparable. I love the fact that it is delicious without sugar and/or milk (though also delicious with either or both as well)--this is coming from someone with a serious sweet tooth.

Several recent studies have shown that it may improve the heart\\'s muscle tone and promote the body\\'s water loss.

It\\'s used for relieving bleeding gums, sore throats and cold sores in South America and Japan. Stevia has been shown to inhibit plaque formation and bacterial growth causing gum disease and tooth decay, and will not cause cavities. It may even reduce cravings for sweets which coupled with its lack of calories may be helpful in weight loss.<br /><br />ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS EVEN MORE:<br /><br />There is anecdotal evidence that Stevia is good for skin problems like acne, cold sores, dermatitis and eczema, and may speed up the healing of cuts and scratches. There have even been reports that Stevia may be useful as a contraceptive, but that has not yet been substantiated by research.<br /><br />FDA APPROVAL TO BE SOLD AS A FOOD SUPPLEMENT -- NOT A SWEETENER<br /><br />Most of all, Stevia, unlike the artificial sweeteners we put in everything from soda to psyllium does not come with any health warnings from the FDA, and it will probably do you no harm. However, Stevia has not been approved to be sold as a sweetener even though it is a NATURAL SWEETENER LIKE SUGAR. Nevertheless, Stevia has been approved [since 1994] to be sold as a dietary supplement in the United States.<br /><br />AFTER ALL THE SMOKE HAS CLEARED THIS IS FOOD - USE IT BY EATING IT!<br /><br />Stevia can be substituted for sugar.

I use it on many things where I can eliminate large amounts of honey and/or sugar such as;<br /><br />1]- Herbal Tea, instead of sugar or honey.<br /><br />2]- In multi-grain hot cereal, when you need to sweeten it, Stevia saves me a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of sugar per large bowl. In this case I just add about a teaspoon of honey and 1/8 teaspoon of stevia for the same effect. Stevia is much sweeter than sugar so use about 1/10th as much in place of sugar.<br /><br />3]- Iced Tea.<br /><br />4]- Pancakes, waffles and French Toast as a replacement for some maple syrup.<br /><br />MEDICINALLY SPEAKING:<br /><br />A standardized extract of 57 mg. containing 85% \"steviocides\" in a beverage, is what Doctor James A.

There is no fat, no cholesterol and almost zero sodium to boot! They offer fiber and potassium and that's good, too.<br /><br />However, this food is not an invariable substitute for a vitamin or other fruits with fiber, minerals and vitamins. They contain sugar (12 grams per serving) and they lack vitamins. I'll have to take off one star for that.<br /><br />In addition, a few of these helps fight constipation really well! Don't eat too many--you'll have stomach trouble--trust me!<br /><br />However, if you want a healthy snack or something to add to your breakfast cereal or oatmeal, these pitted plums are excellent. They taste great and they are far better than any candy to sweeten your food. Moreover, Amazon correctly notes that they do not require refrigeration nor do they bruise or spoil easily. In my personal opinion, I love to refrigerate these and eat them cold. They are remarkably sweet, too.<br /><br />Note: There should be an expiration date printed on the container. Eat or use these before the expiration date so you get them while they're nice and fresh!<br /><br />These pitted plums are great for persons everywhere who prefer to feed their children fruits as a substitute for candy. They are perfect for people who want to sweeten their food with something 100% natural, too. Pitted Plums provide us all with a healthy snack; and that's a huge plus.<br /><br />Highly recommended--to life!\",\n",

       " 'I\\'m a confirmed hot chocolate snob and yes, I admit I only really wanted a Keurig to make a really quick, banging cup of hot chocolate (and maybe not be on a first name basis with every employee at Dunkin Donuts).  In fact, I don\\'t even drink coffee, so the quest for the perfect hot chocolate for the Keurig is not one I take lightly.<br /><br />Of the brands of hot chocolate I\\'ve tried that are made specifically for the Keurig, this one is the best.<br /><br />I tried a couple of brews before I reviewed this...  So here\\'s the conclusion that I\\'ve come to:<br /><br />I have a Keurig Special Edition B60 brewer, and the first brew I did as was suggested by the maker (shake the K-Cup before brewing, brew on 8oz setting).  Of course my brewer doesn\\'t have 8oz, so I brewed at 7.25oz, the \"middle button.\"  The result was a watery cup of hot chocolate with a fair amount of chocolate flavor, but still a little too watered down for me.  The color was really good, rich, dark, and even had some of that nice foamy goodness on the top.  I was *very* happy to see when I looked at the empty K-Cup after brewing that there was almost no powder or residue left in the K-Cup, a problem that the other hot chocolate K-Cups really suffer from no matter how hard you shake them and there was almost no thick chocolate gunk at the bottom of the mug when finished.  Awesome.  So overall, when brewed as suggested, it was the best hot chocolate I\\'ve tried for the K-Cup when prepared as-is, but not the best cup of homemade hot chocolate possible.<br /><br />The next brew I did I shook the K-Cup and brewed on the small cup setting, the 5.25oz brew.  The result was a hot chocolate that was a little thicker, beautiful color, lots of that spectacular white foam on top, something that looked like a REAL hot chocolate.  The flavor was much more defined, a lot more chocolaty, and very smooth and tasty.  Though I did notice that slightly Splenda-like aftertaste which kind of surprised me since I\\'m largely desensitized to that taste (thank you Fruit2O) and honestly it was ever-so-slightly just too sweet.  But wow was it good.  Still not the best hot chocolate to make at home, but really good.<br /><br />Third brew I did I did again on the 5.25oz brew, put a splash of half-and-half in the cup, then brewed.  Holy cow in a hat...  That was awesome.  Finally a substitute for my Dunkin Donuts trips.  So, so, so good.  No aftertaste, right amount of sweetness and creamy texture.  Great, rich color that looks like a melted Hershey Bar.  Right up there with the best hot chocolate one can make at home for sure.  For sure a taste that competes with hot chocolate I\\'ve tried from Dunkin Donuts.<br /><br />So rating this for me was hard...  When made, straight up as suggested, it\\'s OK and even when it\\'s made with less water it\\'s pretty good.  Since I think the Keurig is designed for speedy ease-of-use, I think a lot of people are looking for and expecting that great cup of hot chocolate right out of the box.  In that way, it delivers an OK product, the best K-Cup hot chocolate available now, but not an overall great cup of hot chocolate.  But if you\\'re willing to put two seconds worth of time into making it positively delicious, you will be very richly rewarded with fantastic hot chocolate.<br /><br />I fluctuated between rating 3 stars because, out of the box, it\\'s only OK, and 4 stars because when adjusted it\\'s amazing...  I ended up going 4 star with the assumption that there are a lot of people out there with a Keurig who do coffee or tea where they add creamer and/or sugar to adjust it to their taste, and I see doing this as much the same sort of thing.<br /><br />Hopefully Keurig will put out a hot chocolate soon that\\'s amazing right out of the box.  If we could get them to talk to the Land O Lakes folks (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M5RNTS\">Cocoa Classics Hot Cocoa Drink Mix 7 Variety Pack</a>), there would never be a reason to leave the house for hot chocolate again...',\n",

       " 'I have tried a few varieties of these ECC capsules in my CitiZ machine so far and will submit separate reviews under the different product listings over the coming few days.<br /><br />What\\'s common to all of these capsules is that the CitiZ machine is a little more difficult to close when using an ECC capsule versus a Nespresso capsule. Also, before the espresso starts coming out of the machine, the capsule makes a bit of a popping. Both of these issues are addressed on ECC\\'s website, where they try to assure customers that this is normal and should not cause any concern.<br /><br />So, on to this particular variety, the Espressivo.  I\\'m a little surprised by the other reviews posted so far.  Unless the design of the CitiZ changed drastically, I\\'m not sure why one of the other reviewers was unable to use the ECC capsule.  As to the flavor, while I agree with the other reviewer so far that it isn\\'t as good as Nespresso\\'s darker roasts, I\\'m not in agreement that it\\'s nothing more than bad drip coffee.  I actually think the Espressivo ECC capsule tastes okay -- definitely stronger than drip coffee -- and in my CitiZ it produced as much crema as a Nespresso capsule.  Unfortunately, however, the flavor seems kind of \"one note\" compared to my favorite Nespresso capsules.  Given that the cost of the ECC capsules on Amazon isn\\'t that much less than Nespresso capsules available through the Nespresso club (about a 12% cost savings), one has to factor in the \"green\" factor of the ECC capsules to help them decide which capsule to choose.  While I personally feel a lot better about being able to compost the ECC capsules, I also want the best possible flavor from my CitiZ -- that\\'s why I bought it instead of a much less expensive espresso machine.  I\\'m afraid that unless another variety of the ECC capsules is more to my liking, I\\'ll be sticking with the Nespresso capsules.',\n",

I then switched her to an 'all natuaral' version by the same maker. She did fine on that for awhile then out of the blue she'd have nothing more to do with it. I decided to give wet food a go. As she's becoming more&more picky in her golden years that was a hit&miss ordeal. Seems as fast as I'd  stock up on her favorite variety of a brand she'd decide she didn't want it anymore.  Every other day I'd have to trek out to the store(in the harsh Michigan winter no less)to find something to feed her. I finally decided to pick up a few cans of Fancy Feast at CVS. I had steered clear of FF because of the  high price of those tiny cans. Since I was desperate to get food into kitty I caved. I bought every different variety my local CVS had on the shelf. She didn't want the flaked variety. She wouldn't touch the shredded meals. She loved the food in the gravy,actually she only loved the gravy. Finally I opened up a can of the Salmon and prayed for the best. To my relief she inhaled every bit of it and meowed for more. I moved on to the Cod,Shrimp,&Salmon and got the same positive response. She flipped over the Ocean Whitefish flavor.<br />Hallelulah! I'd hit paydirt!!<br />I don't have a car at present and the trips to the store in a quest to find these 3 flavors of Fancy Feast got tiresome. I decided to use Amazon's Subscribe&Save option. What a life saver that is. I placed the order and received kitty's food in a couple a days. The next month I got an email saying the order was shipping and it arrived a few days later. The service is convienent and the price I pay through Amazon is a few dollars less than I was paying per case at the store,not to mention I didn't have to trek off to the store and haul the food home. It came right to my door without fail.<br />The one problem I ran into is my dear feline friend decided she no longer cares for the Ocean Whitefish or Cod/Shrimp/Salmon flavor. The stray cats outside can't thank her enough for her pickiness lol.<br /> She still loves the Salmon flavor and the Salmon&Shrimp feast.

The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal.

       " \"Breast milk has a plethora of advantages over formula.  Until recently, one of these advantages was that it contained DHA and ARA, fatty acids that are important components of brain structure.<br /><br />Recently, manufacturers have begun adding DHA and ARA to their infant formula.  Some studies have indicated that addition of DHA and ARA to formula provides an advantage of 6-7 IQ points over normal formula, nearly as much as the IQ point advantage of breast fed babies.<br /><br />However, the DHA and ARA added to infant formulas are chemically extracted from certain species of algae and mold using solvents, and are not identical to the DHA and ARA found in breast milk.  There have also been reports that the DHA and ARA supplemented formula causes diarrhea in some children.  In our daughter, it seemed to cause softer and messier stool, though it wasn't quite diarrhea.<br /><br />Baby's only DHA and ARA is extracted from egg yolks using a water based process, and thus may avoid some small risk associated with the solvent extracted versions.  It's mixed into formula that isn't fortified with DHA and ARA or into other foods.  We use it with Baby's Only toddler formula, and it does not cause messy stool with our daughter.<br /><br />Breast feeding is still better than any formula, of course - it has other advantages, such as a protective effect against infections that the formula makers haven't figured out yet.  However, if you must formula feed for some reason - for us, my wife's pumping at work didn't keep up with the baby's demand, and eventually we also had to stop breast feeding to try to start a second baby - mixing Baby's Only DHA and ARA supplement into a nonsupplemented formula is probably the next best thing.\",\n",

If you\\'re growing for one or two people I would recommend the \"Sprout Master Mini Triple\" instead. Coming with three trays the mini triple would allow you to grow a more diverse or more staggered crop.<br /><br />The two \"lids\" that come with this tray are exactly the same. Put one below to catch any water and use the one on top if you want to block off light (this helps prevent the growth of green leaves, which is usually how bean sprouts are grown). The Sprout Master\\'s drainage holes allow excess water to drain off very effectively.<br /><br />If you\\'ve sprouted in a jar before, you\\'ll probably find this to be much easier. Hold the tray under running cool water two or three times a day, then allow excess water to run off before putting the tray away. The sprouts should be thoroughly rinsed to prevent spoilage, kept moist at all times, but not allowed to sit in water. (By comparison, with jar sprouting you\\'d need to fill and drain the jar of sprouts repeatedly to rinse the sprouts well, then it\\'s more difficult to get them properly drained.)<br /><br />One minor complaint is that some of the smallest seeds can get caught in the drain holes.

When you\\'re cleaning the tray after use you may need to get a small poking instrument to knock one or two out again.

       " \"Here's is something that will simplify your wheatgrass growing IMMENSELY!  Begin by soaking about a half-cup of wheat berries (hard winter wheat is usually recommended) twelve hours (more or less) and allowing them to sprout for three days or so.  When you are ready to spread these little sprouts out into your sprouter, first fit one sheet of natural, untreated paper towel in the bottom of the sprouter (you can find these untreated paper towels at almost any healthfood store).  You do not need to trim all the extra around the edges because after dry fitting, you will moisten the paper which will cause it to cling to the sides making a nice neat little container.  You can moisten the fitted paper towel with kitchen sink spray or soft-pressure kitcen faucet water.  Sometimes we moisten it from a kelp-water spray bottle.  Either before or after fitting and moistening the paper towel to the inner contour of the sprouter, try cutting off about an inch and a half triangle from one corner of the fitted paper towel.  This will give you an open corner from which to make later draining of the growing sprouts MUCH faster and easier.  It is also helpful to mark one corner of the sprouter itself so that later on as you are rinsing the growing wheatgrass, you will know where the open draining corner is located.  This will be helpful to know if you want to lean the sprouter at an angle to allow the extra rinse water to run off for a minute.<br /><br />Next you spread the sprouting wheat evenly along the bottom of the moistened paper toweling.  I usually like to come back and spray them with the kitchen sink spray to help distribute them evenly over the bottom of the container, but this can easily be done with your fingers.  If you wish, at this stage you can spray the spread with kelp water.  Then place the container in some window light ... direct sunshine is NOT necessary or recommended, and rinse twice a day ... or more the first few days if you have time. Two will do.<br /><br />After you have chewed or juiced or otherwise ingested your wheatgrass crop and are ready to clean out the stubble and roots, all you have to do is start at any corner and pull out the entire mat in one piece.  The paper towel helps hold the roots (not all but enough to make an easily remmoval one-piece mat)together inside the sprouter.  Once you have disposed of this large mat of roots and stubble, the sprouting container is very simple to clean.  The entire process (removing the remains and cleaning the now empty container does not take me longer than three or four minutes...maybe less.  It certainly has taken me far longer to write this review.  I once tried two layers of paper toweling and the results were nothing like as positive as just the one layer.  Nothing else that I have tried this layering with (except garlic for which I prefer to use a cut piece of Sure-To-Grow (the most economical way to go here is with the 20-foot grow rolls) or nothing at all.  The paper towel layering did not work well at all for buckwheat greens or sunflower greens.  I grow both of these in just a plain empty Master Sprout spouter (large and/or small).  BUT FOR WHEATGRASS, I have never had such great crops with such an easy and fast clean up as with this single-layer, natural paper towel process. Also, I do tend to spray all of my growing sprouts with liquid kelp-water solution, (but you can get plenty of beautifully green crops without it).  The really good news, as far as I am concerned, is no more soil for either wheatgrass or sunflower greens, etc.! Now that I have retired and am living in an apartment, soil is out...paper towels and Master Sprout spouters (with or without paper towels) are in. I hope no one will allow the complications of soil prep, etc. to keep them for great wheatgrass growing.  Also, with these Master Sprout sprouters, other greens for which soil has long been recommended can be grown soil free, e. g., sunflower greens and buckwheat greens.<br /><br />Oh, and one last idea.  The Easy Sprout sprouter is the perfect way to start absolutely everything and for beans (which don't need to be greened). I've been sprouting for over thirty years, and I have never before found it this easy and I credit that to the combination of these two sprouting system.  I don't see how it could be made any easier.  The two together cover all of our sprouting needs: Easy Sprouter takes care of starting all sprouts for later transfer into the Master Sprout containers AND it covers the complete sprouting of beans which do not need greening.  Master Sprouters take care of all the things that need greening.  I am sprouting and cooking for two and make full use of three Easy Spouters, 5 Master Sprouters (the regular larger size), and 3 Master Sprouters (mini).  I keep three wheatgrass sprouters cycling for a constant supply; buckwheat greens and sunflower greens (for salads); garlic and a variety of beans (mostly for soups and stews).  All that is needed for this is one 48-inch wide diningroom window with a 20-inch by 48-inch wide folding table to hold the sprouters in the light.  The Easy Sprouters stay in the kitchen.  As you can see, the entire operation  does not take up much space and yet it gives a much appreciated large quantity of live food year round.  Rinsing takes no more than ten minutes twice a day.\",\n",

I would like for the directions to address this problem, but they do not.  I bought this to replace my jar method, which did not mold, but I have yet to learn the \"technique.\"  If you know what you are doing, I\\'m sure it is great.  I know the first time I sprouted, it molded because I had the bottom upside down and there was no ventilation.  The second time, I\\'m not sure what I did wrong.

       " \"I discovered these oils years ago, bought one of each flavor, and was thunderstruck at the quality. I use these in place of vegetable or olive oil whenever a dish calls for a similar flavor ingredient (to give it the extra flavor &quot;kick&quot;), but I found myself using them sparingly since I didn't know where to find more when they're gone! I'm almost out of the bottles I bought (just opened 2 of them, and they're fresh as ever!) and was thrilled to see them available on Amazon! The Lemon oil makes a wonderful Greek Saganaki (flamed Feta or Kaseri cheese), the Lime oil is fantastic for Thai cooking and it's many lime-based dishes, and the Orange oil I use in Salmon marinades, as well as with Oriental stir-fry &amp; Chinese duck--I may even try it in making Duck a L'Orange! I don't recall what I paid when I initially purchased them, but as gourmet oils are pricey to begin with, I would consider this a reasonable price, especially considering Amazon's free shipping &amp; the convenience of to-your-door delivery! The bottles are also attractive to display, &amp; are so tall &amp; slim that they take up very little space on your counter. Treat yourself to these oils!\",\n",
       " \"This is a review from Marc's wife:<br />  I have throughly tested this Product.<br />Order this exact one: Nestle Nido makes a confusing array of products with similar names and labels!<br />  Con:Taste not IDENTICAL to whole milk!<br />  Pro:Dissolves easily, smells good.<br />  -Tried this as creamer in tea with sugar-a person used to whole milk in his tea thought it tasted fine.<br />  -in cooking- tried it in my favorite pancake recipe-no perceived difference.<br />  -tried using it as substitute for milk in a couple of sauces: no complaints from anyone, I thought it tasted slighty low-fat. Certainly in a cheese or other highly flavored sauce should be fine.<br />  -substituted for half the non-fat dried milk in our instant hot cholate mix recipe. Everyone raved about the flavor! I noticed our mix wasn't being used up at the same phenomenal clip as people professed themselves more satisfied.<br />- Perfect for single people who want small amounts of milk, mostly for creamer in hot beverages. If you're going to use it slowly, maybe put in a glass jar in the fridge.<br />- Disaster supplies;earthquake,hurricane,etc.<br />- save on gasoline! Won't have to make trips for the sole purpose of someone having milk in their coffee or cereal!<br />- Camping,etc. where weight is an issue;bring this powder and reconstitute as needed.<br />Buy it-you will love it! If two cans seems a big quantity for you, give/resell the other one to a friend,neighbor,etc.<br />NEW ADVANTAGES_ADDED 8-01-11<br />-Easier to use in cooking than liquid milk- in any recipe where it calls for scalding and then cooling the milk, you can skip that step by just mixing up the amount of milk used in your recipe from the milk powder and lukewarm water. Faster and saves on pots needed too.<br />-Absolutely ESSENTIAL if you make yougurt at home. Milk solids are added to milk in making yougurt to stiffen the milk so the resulting yougurt will have the texture people have come to expect from store-bought yogurt.By using this whole milk powder instead of nonfat milk powder, the yougurt thickens better, and it tastes better-for the best yogurt you have ever eaten, try homemade yogurt made with whole milk AND this whole milk powder!!\",\n",
       " 'I like the product and have been pleased with it from other vendors. I looked at all the vendors on amazon and found this one to be the best value on a delivered price per ounce value (assuming you have amazon prime). However, the savings was very small compared to the next best value and this particular vendor shipped me containers that the date stamps showed they were already at least half expired. So if you are planning on storing this and not using it all within 6 months, I suggest you buy it elsewhere. If you plan to use it all within 6 months than it is the best value for your money (maybe because it is discounted for being old stock).

       " \"Having tried & adored most of this brand's soup cups, I eagerly grabbed a cup of their lentil & couscous soup. Thirty minutes later, I was pretty underwhelmed by the experience.<br /><br />The soup may have less sodium, but it is incredibly bland tasting. It doesn't need salt, but a pinch of extra seasoning would have helped the taste. This may be great for some, but for me it would deter me from purchasing more of this product unless I were to get some extra seasoning to dump in it.<br /><br />The best part of the soup is that it is incredibly filling- even more so than some of McDougall's other products. It's just that I'd rather have something that tastes good rather than something that is filling. If you don't mind bland food or can season it to perfection, get this product. If you are like me & just don't have the time to season food at work, you may want to skip this & give their other products a try.<br /><br />*Oh, and I recommend letting this sit for 8 minutes rather than 5.
